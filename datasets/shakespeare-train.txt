I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st .
Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .
Madam , he's well .
Well said .
And friends with Caesar .
Th' art an honest man .
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever .
Make thee a fortune from me .
But yet , madam , I do not like "But yet." It does allay The good precedence .
Fie upon "But yet." "But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor .
Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together .
He's friends with Caesar , In state of health , thou say'st , and , thou say'st , free .
Free , madam , no .
I made no such report .
He's bound unto Octavia .
For what good turn ?
For the best turn i' th' bed .
I am pale , Charmian .
Madam , he's married to Octavia .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee !
Good madam , patience .
What say you ?
Hence , horrible villain , or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me !
I'll unhair thy head !
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , Smarting in ling'ring pickle !
Say 'tis not so , a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud .
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
He's married , madam .
Rogue , thou hast lived too long .
Nay then , I'll run .
What mean you , madam ?
I have made no fault .
Good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
The man is innocent .
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt .
Melt Egypt into Nile , and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents .
Call the slave again .
Though I am mad , I will not bite him .
Call !
He is afeard to come .
I will not hurt him .
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself , since I myself Have given myself the cause .
Come hither , sir .
Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news .
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
I have done my duty .
Is he married ?
The gods confound thee !
Dost thou hold there still ?
Should I lie , madam ?
Go , get thee hence .
I crave your highness' pardon .
He is married ?
Take no offense that I would not offend you .
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal .
He's married to Octavia .
Oh , that his fault should make a knave of thee , That art not what th' art sure of !
Get thee hence .
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me .
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by 'em !
Good your highness , patience .
In praising Antony , I have dispraised Caesar .
Many times , madam .
I am paid for 't now .
Lead me from hence .
O Iras , Charmian !
Tis no matter. , Go to the fellow , good Alexas .
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia : her years , Her inclination .
Let him not leave out The color of her hair .
Bring me word how tall she is .
Lead me to my chamber .
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost most absolute Alexas , where's the soothsayer that you praised so to th' Queen ?
Oh that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
I make not , but foresee .
Pray , then , foresee me one .
No , you shall paint when you are old .
Wrinkles forbid !
Vex not his prescience .
Be attentive .
Hush !
You shall be more beloving than beloved .
Most meet That first we come to words , and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent , Which , if thou hast considered , let us know If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here .
What was 't That moved pale Cassius to conspire ?
Take your time .
Thou canst not fear us , Pompey , with thy sails .
We'll speak with thee at sea .
At land , thou know'st How much we do o'ercount thee .
At land indeed Thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house , But since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in 't as thou mayst .
Be pleased to tell us , For this is from the present , how you take The offers we have sent you .
There's the point .
Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embraced .
You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia .
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome .
This 'greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted .
That's our offer .
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer , but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience .
Let me have your hand .
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
The beds i' th' East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by 't .
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
Well met here .
I hope so , Lepidus .
Thus we are agreed .
That's the next to do .
We'll feast each other ere we part , and let's Draw lots who shall begin .
That will I , Pompey .
No , Antony , take the lot .
But , first or last , Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame .
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
You have heard much .
I have fair meanings , sir .
And fair words to them .
Then so much have I heard .
And I have heard Apollodorus carried , What , I pray you ?
How far'st thou , soldier ?
Well , And well am like to do , for I perceive , Four feasts are toward .
Let me shake thy hand .
I never hated thee .
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
Sir , I never loved you much , but I ha' praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
Enjoy thy plainness .
It nothing ill becomes thee. , Aboard my galley I invite you all .
Will you lead , lords ?
Show 's the way , sir .
Come .
At sea , I think .
We have , sir .
You have done well by water .
And you by land .
I will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what I have done by land .
Nor what I have done by water .
Yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
And you by land .
There I deny my land service .
But give me your hand , Menas .
If our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
All men's faces are true , whatsome'er their hands are .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
No slander .
They steal hearts .
We came hither to fight with you .
For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
If he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
You've said , sir .
We looked not for Mark Antony here .
Pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ?
Caesar's sister is called Octavia .
True , sir .
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus .
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius .
Pray ye , sir ?
Tis true .
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
I think so too .
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity .
Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
Who would not have his wife so ?
Not he that himself is not so , which is Mark Antony .
He will to his Egyptian dish again .
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
Antony will use his affection where it is .
He married but his occasion here .
And thus it may be .
Come , sir , will you aboard ?
I have a health for you .
I shall take it , sir .
We have used our throats in Egypt .
Come , let's away .
Here they'll be , man .
Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already .
Lepidus is high-colored .
They have made him drink alms-drink .
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave .
Thus do they , sir : they take the flow o' th' Nile By certain scales i' th' Pyramid .
They know By th' height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow .
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises .
As it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest .
You've strange serpents there ?
Ay , Lepidus .
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .
I am not so well as I should be , but I'll ne'er out .
Not till you have slept .
I fear me you'll be in till then .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things .
Without contradiction I have heard that .
What manner o' thing is your crocodile ?
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
It is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs .
Of it own color too .
Tis a strange serpent .
Tis so .
And the tears of it are wet .
The matter ?
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
Thou hast served me with much faith .
What's else to say ? , These quicksands , Lepidus , Keep off them , for you sink .
What sayst thou ?
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
That's twice .
How should that be ?
Nay , hear him .
Good now , some excellent fortune !
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all .
Oh , excellent !
Then belike my children shall have no names .
Prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ?
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
We'll know all our fortunes .
Mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be , drunk to bed .
Hast thou drunk well ?
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup .
Show me which way .
These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel .
All there is thine .
Ah , this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on 't !
In me 'tis villainy , In thee 't had been good service .
Thou must know , 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; Mine honor , it .
Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act .
Being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now .
Desist , and drink .
This health to Lepidus !
Here's to thee , Menas !
Enobarbus , welcome .
There's a strong fellow , Menas .
Why ?
He bears The third part of the world , man .
Seest not ?
The third part , then , is drunk .
Drink thou .
Come .
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
It ripens towards it .
Strike the vessels , ho !
Here's to Caesar .
I could well forbear 't .
Be a child o' th' time .
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
Let's ha 't , good soldier .
Come , let's all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
All take hands .
What needs more words ?
Good night .
And shall , sir .
Give 's your hand .
We are friends .
Come , down into the boat .
Take heed you fall not .
Menas , I'll not on shore .
No , to my cabin .
What !
There's my cap .
Hoo !
Noble captain , come .
Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck , and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death Make me revenger .
For learn this , Silius : Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away .
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person .
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain ; and ambition , The soldier's virtue , rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him .
I could do more to do Antonius good , But 'twould offend him , and in his offense Should my performance perish .
Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction .
Thou wilt write to Antony ?
I'll humbly signify what in his name , That magical word of war , we have effected : How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o' th' field .
Where is he now ?
What , are the brothers parted ?
They have dispatched with Pompey ; he is gone .
Octavia weeps To part from Rome .
Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
A very fine one .
Oh , how he loves Caesar !
Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony !
Caesar ?
What's Antony ?
The god of Jupiter .
Spake you of Caesar ?
How , the nonpareil !
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird !
Would you praise Caesar , say "Caesar." Go no further .
Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
But he loves Caesar best ; yet he loves Antony .
Hoo !
Hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , hoo ! , His love to Antony .
Both he loves .
They are his shards , and he
So , This is to horse .
Adieu , noble Agrippa .
Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
No further , sir .
For better might we Have loved without this mean , if on both parts This be not cherished .
Make me not offended In your distrust .
I have said .
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear .
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends .
We will here part .
Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort !
Fare thee well .
My noble brother !
The April's in her eyes ; it is love's spring , And these the showers to bring it on .
What , Octavia ?
I'll tell you in your ear .
Look , here I have you .
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .
Adieu .
Be happy .
Farewell , farewell .
Farewell .
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine .
Go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I can not scratch mine ear. , Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
Your fortunes are alike .
But how , but how ?
Give me particulars .
I have said .
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she ?
Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ?
Not in my husband's nose .
Our worser thoughts heavens mend .
Alexas !
For , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded .
Therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
Where is the fellow ?
Half afeard to come .
Go to , go to. , Come hither , sir .
Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased .
That Herod's head I'll have !
Most gracious majesty !
Didst thou behold Octavia ?
Ay , dread Queen .
Where ?
Madam , in Rome .
I looked her in the face , and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony .
Is she as tall as me ?
She is not , madam .
Didst hear her speak ?
Is she shrill-tongued or low ?
Madam , I heard her speak .
She is low-voiced .
That's not so good .
He can not like her long .
Like her ?
O Isis , 'tis impossible .
I think so , Charmian .
She creeps .
She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather .
Is this certain ?
Or I have no observance .
Three in Egypt Can not make better note .
There's nothing in her yet .
The fellow has good judgment .
Excellent .
Charmian , hark .
And I do think she's thirty .
Bear'st thou her face in mind ?
Is 't long or round ?
Round , even to faultiness .
For the most part , too , they are foolish that are so .
Her hair , what color ?
Brown , madam , and her forehead As low as she would wish it .
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill .
I will employ thee back again ; I find thee Most fit for business .
Go make thee ready ; Our letters are prepared .
A proper man .
Indeed , he is so .
I repent me much That so I harried him .
Nothing , madam .
All may be well enough .
I warrant you , madam .
O my good lord , Believe not all , or , if you must believe , Stomach not all .
A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne'er stood between , Praying for both parts .
Gentle Octavia , Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it .
The meantime , lady , I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother .
The Jove of power make me most weak , most weak , Your reconciler !
When it appears to you where this begins , Turn your displeasure that way , for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them .
Provide your going ; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to .
How now , friend Eros !
There's strange news come , sir .
What , man ?
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey .
This is old .
What is the success ?
So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , And throw between them all the food thou hast , They'll grind the one the other .
Where's Antony ?
More , Domitius : My lord desires you presently .
My news I might have told hereafter .
Twill be naught , But let it be .
Bring me to Antony .
Come , sir .
Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria .
Here's the manner of 't : I' th' marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned .
This in the public eye ?
She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so .
Let Rome be thus informed .
Who , queasy with his insolence already , Will their good thoughts call from him .
The people knows it , and have now received His accusations .
Who does he accuse ?
Caesar , and that , having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled , we had not rated him His part o' th' isle .
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping , unrestored .
Sir , this should be answered .
Tis done already , and the messenger gone .
I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel , That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change .
He'll never yield to that .
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
Hail , Caesar , and my lord !
Hail , most dear Caesar !
That ever I should call thee castaway !
You have not called me so , nor have you cause .
Why have you stol'n upon us thus ?
You come not Like Caesar's sister .
The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear .
Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops .
We should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting .
My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted My grieved ear withal , whereon I begged His pardon for return .
Which soon he granted , Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him .
Amen .
Hush !
Here comes Antony .
Saw you my lord ?
No , lady .
Was he not here ?
No , madam .
He was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him. , Enobarbus !
Madam ?
Here at your service .
My lord approaches .
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
Against my brother Lucius ?
Ay .
Do not say so , my lord .
Where is he now ?
My lord , in Athens .
No , my most wronged sister .
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her .
He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' th' earth for war .
He hath assembled Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus , Of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King Of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; King of Pont ; Herod of Jewry ; Mithridates , King Of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia , With a more larger list of scepters .
Ay me , most wretched , That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other !
Welcome hither .
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger .
Cheer your heart .
Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us .
Welcome , lady .
Welcome , dear madam .
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you .
Only th' adulterous Antony , most large In his abominations , turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us .
Most certain .
Sister , welcome .
Pray you Be ever known to patience .
My dear'st sister !
But why , why , why ?
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit .
Is 't not denounced against us ?
Why should not we Be there in person ?
What is 't you say ?
Sink Rome !
And their tongues rot That speak against us !
A charge we bear i' th' war , And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man .
Speak not against it .
I will not stay behind .
Nay , I have done .
Here comes the Emperor .
Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne ? , You have heard on 't , sweet ?
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent .
By sea , what else ?
Why will My lord do so ?
For that he dares us to 't .
So hath my lord dared him to single fight .
Ay , and to wage this battle at Pharsalia , Where Caesar fought with Pompey .
But these offers , Which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , And so should you .
In Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought .
Their ships are yare , yours , heavy .
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea , Being prepared for land .
I'll fight at sea .
But if we fail , We then can do 't at land .
Thy business ?
The news is true , my lord .
He is descried .
Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse .
How now , worthy soldier ?
O noble Emperor , do not fight by sea !
Trust not to rotten planks .
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds ?
Let th' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking .
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot .
Well , well , away .
By Hercules , I think I am i' th' right .
Soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows Not in the power on 't .
So our leader's led , And we are women's men .
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius , are for sea ; But we keep whole by land .
This speed of Caesar's Carries beyond belief .
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
Who's his lieutenant , hear you ?
They say , one Taurus .
Well I know the man .
The Emperor calls Canidius .
With news the time's with labor , and throws forth Each minute some .
Taurus !
My lord ?
Strike not by land ; keep whole .
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill , In eye of Caesar's battle , from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly .
I can behold no longer .
Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them !
What's thy passion ?
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance .
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces .
How appears the fight ?
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , Whom leprosy o'ertake ! , i' th' midst o' th' fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breeze upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
That I beheld .
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view .
Well , what worst ?
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
When it concerns the fool or coward .
On .
Things that are past are done , with me .
Tis thus : Who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , I hear him as he flattered .
O my lord !
Speak to me home .
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome .
Oh , then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us Is as our earing .
Fare thee well awhile .
I never saw an action of such shame .
Experience , manhood , honor , ne'er before Did violate so itself .
Alack , alack !
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably .
Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well .
Oh , he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own !
Ay , are you thereabouts ?
Why then , good night indeed .
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse .
Hark .
Friends , come hither .
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever .
I have a ship Laden with gold .
Fly And make your peace with Caesar .
Fly ?
Not we .
I have fled myself , and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders .
Friends , begone .
I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you .
Begone .
Oh , I followed that I blush to look upon !
My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting .
Friends , begone .
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you .
Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness .
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims .
Let that be left Which leaves itself .
To the seaside straightway !
I will possess you of that ship and treasure .
Leave me , I pray , a little .
Pray you now , Nay , do so , for indeed I have lost command .
Why , what else ?
Let me sit down .
Oh , fie , fie , fie !
Madam !
Madam , O good Empress !
The Queen , my lord , the Queen .
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
He is unqualitied with very shame .
Well then , sustain me .
Most noble sir , arise .
The Queen approaches .
Her head's declined , and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue .
I have offended reputation , A most unnoble swerving .
Sir , the Queen .
Oh , whither hast thou led me , Egypt ?
O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails !
I little thought You would have followed .
Egypt , thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings , And thou shouldst tow me after .
O'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew'st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me .
Oh , my pardon !
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness , who With half the bulk o' th' world played as I pleased , Making and marring fortunes .
You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
Fall not a tear , I say .
One of them rates All that is won and lost .
Give me a kiss .
Even this repays me. , We sent our schoolmaster .
Let him appear that's come from Antony .
Know you him ?
Approach and speak .
Such as I am , I come from Antony .
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
Be 't so .
Declare thine office .
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt ; which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens .
This for him .
Next , Cleopatra does confess thy greatness , Submits her to thy might , and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs , Now hazarded to thy grace .
For Antony , I have no ears to his request .
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend Or take his life there .
This if she perform , She shall not sue unheard .
So to them both .
Fortune pursue thee !
Bring him through the bands .
Caesar , I go .
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
Caesar , I shall .
What shall we do , Enobarbus ?
Think and die .
Is Antony or we in fault for this ?
Antony only , that would make his will Lord of his reason .
Why should he follow ?
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed , he being The mered question .
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing .
Prithee , peace .
Is that his answer ?
Ay , my lord .
The Queen shall then have courtesy , so she Will yield us up ?
He says so .
Let her know 't. , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities .
That head , my lord ?
A messenger from Caesar .
What , no more ceremony ?
See , my women , Against the blown rose may they stop their nose , That kneeled unto the buds. , Admit him , sir .
At your noble pleasure .
He stays upon your will .
What are you ?
Fulvia thy wife is dead .
Where died she ?
In Sicyon .
Her length of sickness , with what else more serious Importeth thee to know , this bears .
Forbear me .
Caesar's will ?
Hear it apart .
None but friends .
Say boldly .
So haply are they friends to Antony .
He needs as many , sir , as Caesar has , Or needs not us .
If Caesar please , our master Will leap to be his friend .
For us , you know Whose he is we are , and that is Caesar's .
So. , Thus then , thou most renowned : Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand'st , Further than he is Caesar .
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
Oh !
He is a god and knows What is most right .
Mine honor was not yielded , But conquered merely .
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ?
For he partly begs To be desired to give .
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon .
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud , The universal landlord .
What's your name ?
My name is Thidias .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation : I kiss his conqu'ring hand .
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet , and there to kneel .
Favors ?
By Jove that thunders !
What art thou , fellow ?
You will be whipped .
Take hence this jack and whip him .
Moon and stars !
Whip him .
Were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar , should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here , what's her name Since she was Cleopatra ?
Whip him , fellows , Till like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy .
Take him hence .
This jack of Caesar's shall Bear us an errand to him .
Good my lord , You have been a boggler ever .
But when we in our viciousness grow hard , Oh , misery on 't ! , the wise gods seel our eyes , In our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us Adore our errors , laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion .
Oh , is 't come to this ?
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar's trencher .
Nay , you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey's , besides what hotter hours , Unregistered in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously picked out .
For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
Wherefore is this ?
Soundly , my lord .
Cried he ?
And begged he pardon ?
He did ask favor .
Have you done yet ?
Alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , And it portends alone the fall of Antony .
To flatter Caesar , would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points ?
Not know me yet ?
Coldhearted toward me ?
Ah , dear , if I be so , From my cold heart let heaven engender hail , And poison it in the source , and the first stone Drop in my neck .
As it determines , so Dissolve my life !
The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey !
I am satisfied .
Caesar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate .
Our force by land Hath nobly held .
Our severed navy too Have knit again , and fleet , threat'ning most sealike .
Where hast thou been , my heart ?
Dost thou hear , lady ?
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood .
I and my sword will earn our chronicle .
There's hope in 't yet .
That's my brave lord !
I will be treble-sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , And fight maliciously .
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests ; but now I'll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me .
Come , Let's have one other gaudy night .
Call to me All my sad captains .
Let's mock the midnight bell .
It is my birthday .
I had thought t' have held it poor ; but since my lord Is Antony again , I will be Cleopatra .
We will yet do well .
Do so .
We'll speak to them , and tonight I'll force The wine peep through their scars. , Come on , my Queen , There's sap in 't yet .
Now he'll outstare the lightning .
When valor preys on reason , It eats the sword it fights with .
I will seek Some way to leave him .
He calls me "boy" and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt .
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die , meantime Laugh at his challenge .
Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction .
Never anger Made good guard for itself .
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight .
Within our files there are , Of those that served Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in .
See it done And feast the army .
We have store to do 't , And they have earned the waste .
Poor Antony !
What's your pleasure , sir ?
I must with haste from hence .
Why , then , we kill all our women .
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
If they suffer our departure , death's the word .
I must be gone .
Under a compelling occasion , let women die .
It were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing .
Cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
She is cunning past man's thought .
We can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .
He will not fight with me , Domitius ?
No .
Why should he not ?
He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one .
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight .
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again .
Woo't thou fight well ?
I'll strike and cry , "Take all." Well said .
Come on !
Call forth my household servants .
Let's tonight Be bounteous at our meal .
You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
The gods forbid !
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffered my command .
Look , they weep , And I , an ass , am onion-eyed .
Ho , ho , ho !
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus !
Grace grow where those drops fall !
My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort , did desire you To burn this night with torches .
Know , my hearts , I hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than death and honor .
Brother , good night .
Tomorrow is the day .
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
Nothing .
What news ?
Belike 'tis but a rumor .
Good night to you .
Well , sir , good night .
Soldiers , have careful watch .
And you .
Here we .
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
Tis a brave army , and full of purpose .
Peace !
What noise ?
Hark !
Music i' th' air .
Under the earth .
It signs well , does it not ?
No .
Peace , I say !
What should this mean ?
How now , masters ?
Ay .
Is 't not strange ?
Do you hear , masters ?
Do you hear ?
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; Let's see how it will give off .
Content .
Tis strange .
Sleep a little .
Come , good fellow , put thine iron on .
If fortune be not ours today , it is Because we brave her .
Come .
Nay , I'll help too .
What's this for ?
Ah , let be , let be !
Thou art The armorer of my heart .
False , false .
This , this .
Sooth , la , I'll help .
Thus it must be .
Well , well , We shall thrive now. , Seest thou , my good fellow ?
Go put on thy defenses .
Briefly , sir .
Is not this buckled well ?
Rarely , rarely .
Dispatch. , O love , That thou couldst see my wars today , and knew'st The royal occupation !
Good morrow to thee .
Welcome .
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge .
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to 't with delight .
A thousand , sir , Early though 't be , have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you .
The morn is fair .
Good morrow , General .
Good morrow , General .
Tis well blown , lads .
This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes .
Fare thee well , dame .
Whate'er becomes of me , This is a soldier's kiss .
I'll leave thee Now like a man of steel .
Lead me .
He goes forth gallantly .
The gods make this a happy day to Antony !
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land !
Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Followed thy heels .
Who's gone this morning ?
Who ?
One ever near thee .
Sir , He is with Caesar .
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
Is he gone ?
Most certain .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after .
Do it .
Detain no jot , I charge thee .
Write to him , I will subscribe , gentle adieus and greetings .
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master .
Oh , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men !
Dispatch. , Enobarbus !
Fulvia is dead .
Sir ?
Fulvia is dead .
Fulvia ?
Dead .
Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented .
This grief is crowned with consolation .
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
The business she hath broached in the state Can not endure my absence .
And the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of Cleopatra's , which wholly depends on your abode .
No more light answers .
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose .
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part .
For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us , but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home .
Much is breeding Which , like the courser's hair , hath yet but life , And not a serpent's poison .
Say our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence .
Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight .
Our will is Antony be took alive .
Make it so known .
Caesar , I shall .
The time of universal peace is near .
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself .
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him .
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust .
I have done ill , Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more .
Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus .
The messenger Came on my guard , and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules .
I give it you .
Mock not , Enobarbus .
I tell you true .
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host .
I must attend mine office , Or would have done 't myself .
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove .
I am alone the villain of the earth , And feel I am so most .
O Antony , Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold !
This blows my heart .
If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought , but thought will do 't , I feel .
I fight against thee ?
No , I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die .
The foul'st best fits My latter part of life .
Retire !
We have engaged ourselves too far .
Caesar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected .
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed !
Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
Thou bleed'st apace .
I had a wound here that was like a "T , " But now 'tis made an "H." They do retire .
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes .
I have yet Room for six scotches more .
They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
Let us score their backs And snatch 'em up , as we take hares , behind !
Tis sport to maul a runner .
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor .
Come thee on .
I'll halt after .
We have beat him to his camp .
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests .
Tomorrow , Before the sun shall see 's , we'll spill the blood That has today escaped .
Lord of lords !
O infinite virtue , com'st thou smiling from The world's great snare uncaught ?
Mine nightingale , We have beat them to their beds .
What , girl , though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha' we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth .
Behold this man .
He hath fought today As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroyed in such a shape .
He has deserved it , were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus' car .
If we be not relieved within this hour , We must return to th' court of guard .
O bear me witness , night , What man is this ?
Stand close and list him .
Be witness to me , O thou blessed moon , When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory , poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent .
Enobarbus ?
Peace !
Hark further .
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault , Which , being dried with grief , will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts .
O Antony !
Let's speak to him .
Let's hear him , for the things he speaks may concern Caesar .
Let's do so .
But he sleeps .
Swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep .
Go we to him .
Awake , sir , awake .
Speak to us .
Hear you , sir ?
The hand of death hath raught him .
Let us bear him To th' court of guard .
He is of note .
Our hour Is fully out .
Come on , then .
He may recover yet .
I shall do 't .
Their preparation is today by sea .
We please them not by land .
For both , my lord .
I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air , We'd fight there too .
But this it is : our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us .
To the vales , And hold our best advantage .
Yet they are not joined .
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all .
I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go .
Swallows have built In Cleopatra's sails their nests .
All is lost !
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me .
Triple-turned whore !
Bid them all fly , For when I am revenged upon my charm , I have done all .
Bid them all fly .
Begone !
O sun , thy uprise shall I see no more .
Fortune and Antony part here .
Even here Do we shake hands .
All come to this ?
Betrayed I am .
Oh , this false soul of Egypt !
Ah , thou spell !
Avaunt !
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish Caesar's triumph .
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians !
Follow his chariot , like the greatest spot Of all thy sex .
Most monsterlike be shown For poor'st diminutives , for dolts , and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her prepared nails !
She dies for 't. , Eros , ho !
Help me , my women !
To th' monument !
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off .
Say that the last I spoke was "Antony , " And word it , prithee , piteously .
Hence , Mardian , And bring me how he takes my death .
Eros , thou yet behold'st me ?
Ay , noble lord .
Thou hast seen these signs .
Ay , my lord .
That which is now a horse , even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water .
It does , my lord .
My good knave Eros , now thy captain is Even such a body .
Here I am Antony , Yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
Nay , weep not , gentle Eros .
Oh , thy vile lady !
She has robbed me of my sword .
Hence , saucy eunuch !
Peace !
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharged .
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand .
The last she spake Was "Antony , most noble Antony ! " Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony .
It was divided Between her heart and lips .
She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
Dead , then ?
Dead .
Unarm , Eros .
Go .
Off , pluck off !
O , cleave , my sides !
Heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
Crack thy frail case ! , Apace , Eros , apace .
No more a soldier .
Bruised pieces , go .
You have been nobly borne .
I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon .
Since the torch is out , Lie down and stray no farther .
Now all labor Mars what it does .
Yea , very force entangles Itself with strength .
Seal then , and all is done. , Eros ! , I come , my Queen. , Eros ! , Stay for me .
Where souls do couch on flowers , we'll hand in hand , And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze .
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours. , Come , Eros , Eros !
What would my lord ?
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness .
Do 't .
The time is come .
Thou strik'st not me , 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st .
Put color in thy cheek .
The gods withhold me !
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
Eros , Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdued To penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensued ?
I would not see 't .
Draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country .
O sir , pardon me !
When I did make thee free , swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee ?
Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed .
Draw and come .
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
Lo thee !
Where is he ?
I did not see him since .
What should I do I do not ?
In each thing give him way .
Cross him in nothing .
Tempt him not so too far .
I wish , forbear .
In time we hate that which we often fear .
But here comes Antony .
I am sick and sullen .
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , Help me away , dear Charmian !
I shall fall .
My sword is drawn .
My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
Tis said , man , and farewell .
Farewell , great chief .
Shall I strike now ?
Now , Eros .
Why , there then !
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death .
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record .
To do thus I learned of thee .
How !
Not dead ?
Oh , dispatch me !
What's the noise ?
I have done my work ill , friends .
Oh , make an end Of what I have begun !
The star is fall'n .
And time is at his period .
Alas , and woe !
Let him that loves me strike me dead .
Not I .
Nor I .
Nor anyone .
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
Where's Antony ?
There , Diomed , there .
Lives he ?
Wilt thou not answer , man ?
Art thou there , Diomed ?
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death .
Most absolute lord , My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee .
When did she send thee ?
Now , my lord .
Where is she ?
Locked in her monument .
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass .
For when she saw , Which never shall be found , you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar , and that your rage Would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead .
Too late , good Diomed .
Call my guard , I prithee .
What ho , the Emperor's guard !
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides .
Tis the last service that I shall command you .
Woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear All your true followers out .
Most heavy day !
Nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows .
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly .
Take me up .
I have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , And have my thanks for all .
O Charmian , I will never go from hence .
Be comforted , dear madam .
No , I will not .
All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise .
Our size of sorrow , Proportioned to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it .
How now ?
Is he dead ?
His death's upon him , but not dead .
O Antony , Antony , Antony !
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Peace !
Not Caesar's valor hath o'erthrown Antony , But Antony's hath triumphed on itself .
So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony , but woe 'tis so !
Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure .
Those his goodly eyes , That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front .
His captain's heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy's lust .
Look where they come .
Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet's fool .
Behold and see .
If it be love indeed , tell me how much .
There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
Only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips .
I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon , I dare not , Lest I be taken .
Not th' imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me .
If knife , drugs , serpents , have Edge , sting , or operation , I am safe .
Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me .
Assist , good friends .
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
Here's sport indeed !
How heavy weighs my lord !
Had I great Juno's power , The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove's side .
And welcome , welcome !
Die when thou hast lived .
Had my lips that power , Thus would I wear them out .
A heavy sight !
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
Give me some wine and let me speak a little .
My resolution and my hands I'll trust , None about Caesar .
Now my spirit is going .
I can no more .
Noblest of men , woo't die ?
Hast thou no care of me ?
Shall I abide In this dull world , which in thy absence is No better than a sty ?
My lord !
Oh , withered is the garland of the war .
The soldier's pole is fall'n !
Young boys and girls Are level now with men .
The odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon .
She's dead too , our sovereign .
Lady !
Madam !
O madam , madam , madam !
Royal Egypt , Empress !
Peace , peace , Iras .
No more but e'en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares .
All's but naught .
How do you , women ?
What , what , good cheer !
Why , how now , Charmian ?
My noble girls !
Good sirs , take heart .
We'll bury him , and then , what's brave , what's noble , Let's do 't after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us .
Come , away .
This case of that huge spirit now is cold .
Ah , women , women !
Come .
We have no friend But resolution , and the briefest end .
Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield .
Being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks The pauses that he makes .
Caesar , I shall .
Wherefore is that ?
And what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us ?
I am called Dercetus .
Mark Antony I served , who best was worthy Best to be served .
Whilst he stood up and spoke , He was my master , and I wore my life To spend upon his haters .
If thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life .
What is 't thou say'st ?
I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack .
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens .
The death of Antony Is not a single doom .
In the name lay A moiety of the world .
Now , my dearest Queen , Pray you , stand farther from me .
What's the matter ?
I know by that same eye there's some good news .
What , says the married woman you may go ?
Would she had never given you leave to come !
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here .
I have no power upon you .
Hers you are .
The gods best know , Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed !
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
Cleopatra , Why should I think you can be mine , and true , Though you in swearing shake the throned gods , Who have been false to Fulvia ?
Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing !
When you sued staying , Then was the time for words .
No going then !
Eternity was in our lips and eyes , Bliss in our brows' bent , none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven .
They are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turned the greatest liar .
This is his sword .
I robbed his wound of it .
Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
Look you , sad friends , The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings .
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity , but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men .
Caesar is touched .
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day , Or look on thine .
Hear me , good friends ,
But I will tell you at some meeter season .
The business of this man looks out of him .
We'll hear him what he says .
Bid her have good heart .
She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her , for Caesar can not live To be ungentle .
So the gods preserve thee !
Come hither , Proculeius .
Go and say We purpose her no shame .
Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her .
Caesar , I shall .
Gallus , go you along .
Where's Dolabella , To second Proculeius ?
Dolabella !
Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employed .
He shall in time be ready .
Go with me and see What I can show in this .
Tis paltry to be Caesar .
Not being Fortune , he's but Fortune's knave , A minister of her will .
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt , And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee .
What's thy name ?
My name is Proculeius .
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting .
If your master Would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , That majesty , to keep decorum , must No less beg than a kingdom .
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
Be of good cheer .
You're fall'n into a princely hand .
Fear nothing .
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency , and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to .
Pray you , tell him I am his fortune's vassal , and I send him The greatness he has got .
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i' th' face .
This I'll report , dear lady .
You see how easily she may be surprised .
Royal Queen !
O Cleopatra !
Hold , worthy lady , hold !
Do not yourself such wrong , who are in this Relieved but not betrayed .
What , of death too , That rids our dogs of languish ?
Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master's bounty by Th' undoing of yourself .
Let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth .
Where art thou , Death ?
Come hither , come !
Come , come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars !
Oh , temperance , lady !
This mortal house I'll ruin , Do Caesar what he can .
Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinioned at your master's court , Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia .
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ?
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me .
Rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring .
Rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains !
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar .
Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee .
For the Queen , I'll take her to my guard .
So , Dolabella , It shall content me best .
Be gentle to her .
Most noble Empress , you have heard of me ?
I can not tell .
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
Is 't not your trick ?
I understand not , madam .
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony .
Oh , such another sleep , that I might see But such another man !
His reared arm Crested the world .
For his bounty , There was no winter in 't , an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping .
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets .
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket .
Cleopatra , Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of ?
Gentle madam , no .
You lie up to the hearing of the gods .
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy , yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
Hear me , good madam .
Your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it As answering to the weight .
Would I might never O'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
I thank you , sir .
Know you what Caesar means to do with me ?
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew .
Arise , you shall not kneel .
I pray you , rise .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus .
Take to you no hard thoughts .
I'll take my leave .
And may , through all the world !
Tis yours , and we , Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please .
Here , my good lord .
How now , lady ?
I would I had thy inches .
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt .
Hear me , Queen : The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you .
Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords .
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome .
My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia's death .
Can Fulvia die ?
She's dead , my Queen .
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra .
This is the brief of money , plate , and jewels I am possessed of .
Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted .
Where's Seleucus ?
Here , madam .
This is my treasurer .
Let him speak , my lord , Upon his peril , that I have reserved To myself nothing .
Madam , I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not .
What have I kept back ?
Enough to purchase what you have made known .
Nay , blush not , Cleopatra .
See , Caesar !
Oh , behold How pomp is followed !
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild .
Thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee !
But I'll catch thine eyes , Though they had wings .
Oh , rarely base !
Cleopatra , Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i' th' roll of conquest .
Still be 't yours .
Bestow it at your pleasure , and believe Caesar's no merchant , to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold .
Therefore be cheered .
No , dear Queen , For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel .
Feed and sleep .
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend .
And so , adieu .
My master , and my lord !
Not so .
Adieu .
But , hark thee , Charmian .
Finish , good lady .
Madam , I will .
Where's the Queen ?
Behold , sir .
Dolabella !
Make your best use of this .
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise .
Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor .
I your servant .
Adieu , good Queen .
I must attend on Caesar .
Farewell , and thanks .
Now , Iras , what think'st thou ?
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome , as well as I .
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view .
The gods forbid !
Nay , 'tis most certain , Iras .
Oh , the good gods !
Nay , that's certain .
I'll never see 't !
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
Why , that's the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents .
Now , Charmian !
Show me , my women , like a queen .
Go fetch My best attires .
Wherefore's this noise ?
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness' presence .
He brings you figs .
Let him come in .
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed !
He brings me liberty .
My resolution's placed , and I have nothing Of woman in me .
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant .
Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine .
This is the man .
Avoid , and leave him .
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there , That kills and pains not ?
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ?
Very many , men and women too .
Truly , she makes a very good report o' th' worm .
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do .
But this is most falliable , the worm's an odd worm .
I wish you all joy of the worm .
Farewell .
You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
Ay , ay .
Farewell .
Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .
Very good .
Will it eat me ?
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman .
Well , get thee gone .
Farewell .
Give me my robe .
Put on my crown .
I have Immortal longings in me .
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick .
Methinks I hear Antony call .
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act .
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar , which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath. , Husband , I come !
Now to that name my courage prove my title !
I am fire and air , my other elements I give to baser life. , So , have you done ?
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips .
Farewell , kind Charmian .
Iras , long farewell .
Have I the aspic in my lips ?
Dost fall ?
If thou and nature can so gently part , The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch , Which hurts , and is desired .
Dost thou lie still ?
If thus thou vanishest , thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking .
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep !
Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie .
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch .
Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied !
O eastern star !
Peace , peace !
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast , That sucks the nurse asleep ?
As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , O Antony ! , Nay , I will take thee too .
What should I stay , In this wild world ?
So , fare thee well .
Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled .
Downy windows , close ,
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal !
Your crown's awry .
I'll mend it and then play , Where's the Queen ?
Speak softly .
Wake her not .
Caesar hath sent , Too slow a messenger .
Oh , come apace , dispatch !
I partly feel thee .
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar .
Call him .
What work is here , Charmian ?
Is this well done ?
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings .
Ah , soldier !
How goes it here ?
All dead .
Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this .
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder .
O most false love !
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water ?
Now I see , I see , In Fulvia's death how mine received shall be .
By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime , I go from hence Thy soldier , servant , making peace or war As thou affects .
Cut my lace , Charmian , come !
But let it be .
I am quickly ill , and well , So Antony loves .
My precious Queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial .
So Fulvia told me .
I prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt .
O sir , you are too sure an augurer .
That you did fear is done .
The manner of their deaths ?
I do not see them bleed .
Who was last with them ?
A simple countryman that brought her figs .
This was his basket .
Poisoned , then .
Oh , Caesar , This Charmian lived but now .
She stood and spake .
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress .
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped .
Oh , noble weakness !
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood , and something blown .
The like is on her arm .
This is an aspic's trail , and these fig leaves Have slime upon them , such as th' aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile .
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument .
She shall be buried by her Antony .
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous .
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral , And then to Rome .
Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
You'll heat my blood .
No more .
You can do better yet , but this is meetly .
Now , by my sword , And target .
I'll leave you , lady .
Courteous lord , one word .
Sir , you and I must part , but that's not it .
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this .
But , sir , forgive me , Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you .
Your honor calls you hence .
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , And all the gods go with you !
Upon your sword Sit laurel victory , and smooth success Be strewed before your feet .
Let us go .
Come .
Our separation so abides and flies That thou , residing here , goes yet with me , And I , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
You are too indulgent .
Say this becomes him , As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things can not blemish , yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness .
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness , Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for 't .
Here's more news .
Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar .
I should have known no less .
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were , And the ebbed man , ne'er loved till ne'er worth love , Comes deared by being lacked .
Caesar , I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas , famous pirates , Make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound With keels of every kind .
Many hot inroads They make in Italy , the borders maritime Lack blood to think on 't , and flush youth revolt .
Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails .
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought'st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer .
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at .
Tis pity of him .
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome .
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field , and to that end Assemble we immediate council .
Pompey Thrives in our idleness .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time .
Till which encounter It is my business too .
Farewell .
Farewell , my lord .
Charmian !
Madam ?
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away .
You think of him too much .
Oh , 'tis treason !
Madam , I trust , not so .
What's your highness' pleasure ?
Not now to hear thee sing .
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has .
Tis well for thee That , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt .
Hast thou affections ?
Yes , gracious madam .
Indeed ?
Not in deed , madam , for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done .
Stands he or sits he ?
Or does he walk ?
Or is he on his horse ?
O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony !
He's speaking now , Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile ? " For so he calls me .
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison .
Think on me , That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time .
Nay , hear them , Antony .
Perform 't , or else we damn thee." How , my love ?
Perchance ?
Nay , and most like .
You must not stay here longer .
Call in the messengers .
As I am Egypt's queen , Thou blushest , Antony , and that blood of thine Is Caesar's homager .
The messengers !
Sovereign of Egypt , hail !
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony !
Yet , coming from him , that great med'cine hath With his tinct gilded thee .
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony ?
Last thing he did , dear Queen , He kissed , the last of many doubled kisses , This orient pearl .
Mine ear must pluck it thence .
Good friend , " quoth he , "Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , To mend the petty present , I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms .
All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress." So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
What was he , sad or merry ?
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes Of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
Note him , Note him , good Charmian , 'tis the man , but note him .
He was not sad , for he would shine on those That make their looks by his .
He was not merry , Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy , but between both .
O heavenly mingle !
Be'st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else. , Mett'st thou my posts ?
Ay , madam , twenty several messengers .
Why do you send so thick ?
Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar .
Ink and paper , Charmian .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
Did I , Charmian , Ever love Caesar so ?
Oh , that brave Caesar !
Be choked with such another emphasis !
Say , "the brave Antony." The valiant Caesar !
By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men .
By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you .
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then .
We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good , so find we profit By losing of our prayers .
I shall do well .
The people love me , and the sea is mine .
My powers are crescent , and my auguring hope Says it will come to th' full .
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner , and will make No wars without doors .
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts .
Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flattered , but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him .
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field .
A mighty strength they carry .
Where have you this ?
Tis false .
From Silvius , sir .
He dreams .
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony .
But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
Let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , Keep his brain fuming .
This is most certain that I shall deliver : Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected .
Since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for farther travel .
His soldiership Is twice the other twain .
But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er lust-wearied Antony .
I can not hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together .
I know not , Menas , How lesser enmities may give way to greater .
Be 't as our gods will have 't .
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands .
Come , Menas .
Good Enobarbus , 'tis a worthy deed , And shall become you well , to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech .
I shall entreat him To answer like himself .
By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio's beard , I would not shave 't today .
Tis not a time for private stomaching .
But small to greater matters must give way .
Not if the small come first .
Here comes the noble Antony .
And yonder , Caesar .
Tis spoken well .
Were we before our armies , and to fight , I should do thus .
Welcome to Rome .
Thank you .
Sit .
Sit , sir .
Nay , then .
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little , I Should say myself offended , and with you Chiefly i' th' world ; more laughed at , that I should Once name you derogately , when to sound your name It not concerned me .
My being in Egypt , Caesar , what was 't to you ?
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt .
Yet if you there Did practice on my state , your being in Egypt Might be my question .
How intend you , "practiced" ?
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me .
Your wife and brother Made wars upon me , and their contestation Was theme for you .
You were the word of war .
You do mistake your business .
My brother never Did urge me in his act .
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours , And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause ?
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you .
If you'll patch a quarrel , As matter whole you have to make it with , It must not be with this .
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me , but You patched up your excuses .
Not so , not so .
I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace .
As for my wife , I would you had her spirit in such another .
The third o' th' world is yours , which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife .
For that you must But say I could not help it .
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria .
Three kings I had newly feasted , and did want Of what I was i' th' morning .
But next day I told him of myself , which was as much As to have asked him pardon .
Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife .
Hear the ambassadors .
No messenger but thine , and all alone Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people .
You have broken The article of your oath , which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with .
Soft , Caesar .
No , Lepidus , let him speak .
The honor is sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lacked it. , But , on , Caesar .
The article of my oath ?
To lend me arms and aid when I required them , The which you both denied .
Neglected , rather , And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge .
Tis noble spoken .
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye , to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
Worthily spoken , Maecenas .
Or , if you borrow one another's love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of Pompey , return it again .
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
Thou art a soldier only .
Therefore speak no more .
Go to , then .
Give me leave , Caesar .
Speak , Agrippa .
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side , Admired Octavia .
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower .
Say not so , Agrippa .
If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserved of rashness .
I am not married , Caesar .
Let me hear Agrippa further speak .
By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing .
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her .
Will Caesar speak ?
The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment !
There's my hand .
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly .
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again !
Happily , amen !
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey , For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me .
Time calls upon 's .
Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .
Where lies he ?
What is his strength by land ?
Great and increasing .
But by sea he is an absolute master .
So is the fame .
Let us , Lepidus , not lack your company .
Noble Antony , not sickness should detain me .
Good Enobarbus !
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
You stayed well by 't in Egypt .
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there !
Is this true ?
This was but as a fly by an eagle .
We had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
I will tell you .
The poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them .
The oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes .
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling Cupids , With divers-colored fans , whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , And what they undid did .
Oh , rare for Antony !
Upon her landing , Antony sent to her , Invited her to supper .
She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated .
Royal wench !
Now Antony must leave her utterly .
Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety .
Other women cloy The appetites they feed , but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies , for vilest things Become themselves in her , that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish .
Let us go .
Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
Humbly , sir , I thank you .
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you .
Good night .
If you can , your reason ?
But yet hie you to Egypt again .
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , Caesar's or mine ?
Caesar's .
Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side .
Thy daemon , that thy spirit which keeps thee , is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable Where Caesar's is not .
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard , as being o'erpowered .
Therefore Make space enough between you .
Rest you happy !
Speak this no more .
To none but thee , no more but when to thee .
If thou dost play with him at any game , Thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck He beats thee 'gainst the odds .
Thy luster thickens When he shines by .
I will to Egypt .
And though I make this marriage for my peace , I' th' East my pleasure lies .
O come , Ventidius .
You must to Parthia .
Your commission's ready .
Follow me and receive 't .
Trouble yourselves no further .
Pray you , hasten Your generals after .
Sir , Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia , and we'll follow .
Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
Your way is shorter .
My purposes do draw me much about .
You'll win two days upon me .
Sir , good success .
Farewell .
Give me some music .
Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
The music , ho !
Let it alone .
Let's to billiards .
Come , Charmian .
My arm is sore .
As well as I can , madam .
I'll none now .
Give me mine angle .
We'll to th' river .
There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny-finned fishes .
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren .
Madam , madam , Antonio's dead !
If thou say so , villain , Thou kill'st thy mistress .
But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .
First , madam , he is well .
Why , there's more gold .
But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well .
Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat .
Good madam , hear me .
Well , go to , I will .
But there's no goodness in thy face , if Antony Be free and healthful , so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings !
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son , As you have whispered faithfully you were , And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face , Be truly welcome hither .
I am the duke That loved your father .
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me. , Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is .
Support him by the arm .
Give me your hand , And let me all your fortunes understand .
Not see him since ?
Sir , sir , that can not be .
But were I not the better part made mercy , I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge , thou present .
But look to it : Find out thy brother , wheresoe'er he is .
Bring him , dead or living , Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory .
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee .
Oh , that your Highness knew my heart in this : I never loved my brother in my life .
More villain thou. , Well , push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands .
Do this expediently , and turn him going .
Hang there , my verse , in witness of my love .
And how like you this shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
Truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life ; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life , it is naught .
In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
Now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
Such a one is a natural philosopher .
Wast ever in court , shepherd ?
No , truly .
Then thou art damned .
Nay , I hope .
Your reason .
Why , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw'st good manners ; if thou never saw'st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
Not a whit , Touchstone .
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
Instance , briefly .
Come , instance .
Why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
Why , do not your courtier's hands sweat ?
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
A better instance , I say .
Come .
Besides , our hands are hard .
Your lips will feel them the sooner .
Come .
Most shallow man .
Thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
Learn of the wise and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
Mend the instance , shepherd .
You have too courtly a wit for me .
I'll rest .
Good morrow to your Worship .
Can you tell if Rosalind , the duke's daughter , be banished with her father ?
Where will the old duke live ?
Wilt thou rest damned ?
God help thee , shallow man .
God make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
No jewel is like Rosalind .
Her worth being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind .
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind .
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind .
I'll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .
It is the right butter-women's rank to market .
Out , fool .
For a taste : If a hart do lack a hind , Let him seek out Rosalind .
If the cat will after kind , So , be sure , will Rosalind .
Winter garments must be lined , So must slender Rosalind .
They that reap must sheaf and bind , Then to cart with Rosalind .
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind ; Such a nut is Rosalind .
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love's prick , and Rosalind .
This is the very false gallop of verses .
Why do you infect yourself with them ?
Peace , you dull fool .
I found them on a tree .
Truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
You have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
Peace .
But upon the fairest boughs , Or at every sentence end , Will I "Rosalinda" write , Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show .
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged .
Nature presently distilled Helen's cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra's majesty , Atalanta's better part , Sad Lucretia's modesty .
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised , Of many faces , eyes , and hearts To have the touches dearest prized .
Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave .
Didst thou hear these verses ?
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
Ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
Is it a man ?
And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
Change you color ?
I prithee , who ?
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
Nay , but who is it ?
Is it possible ?
Nay , I prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !
Good my complexion , dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man , I have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery .
I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
I would thou couldst stammer , that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that I may drink thy tidings .
So you may put a man in your belly .
Is he of God's making ?
What manner of man ?
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
Nay , he hath but a little beard .
Why , God will send more , if the man will be thankful .
Let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
It is young Orlando , that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant .
Nay , but the devil take mocking .
I ' faith , coz , 'tis he .
Orlando ?
Orlando .
What did he when thou saw'st him ?
What said he ?
How looked he ?
Wherein went he ?
What makes him here ?
Did he ask for me ?
Where remains he ?
How parted he with thee ?
And when shalt thou see him again ?
Answer me in one word .
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel ?
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
But take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
It may well be called Jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit .
Give me audience , good madam .
Proceed .
There lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .
Though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
Cry "holla" to thy tongue , I prithee .
It curvets unseasonably .
He was furnished like a hunter .
Oh , ominous !
He comes to kill my heart .
I would sing my song without a burden .
Thou bring'st me out of tune .
Do you not know I am a woman ?
When I think , I must speak .
Sweet , say on .
You bring me out .
Soft , comes he not here ?
Tis he .
I thank you for your company , but , good faith , I had as lief have been myself alone .
And so had I , but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
God be wi ' you .
Let's meet as little as we can .
I do desire we may be better strangers .
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
Rosalind is your love's name ?
Yes , just .
I do not like her name .
What stature is she of ?
Just as high as my heart .
You are full of pretty answers .
The worst fault you have is to be in love .
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue .
I am weary of you .
There I shall see mine own figure .
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
I'll tarry no longer with you .
Farewell , good Signior Love .
I am glad of your departure .
Adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy .
Very well .
What would you ?
You should ask me what time o ' day .
There's no clock in the forest .
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
Marry , do I , sir , and I came to acquaint you with a matter .
I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
Tomorrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
Your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love I would be loath to foil him , as I must for my own honor if he come in .
Therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
Charles , I thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite .
I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .
I'll tell thee , Charles : it is the stubbornest young fellow of France , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man's good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother .
Therefore use thy discretion .
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
And why not the swift foot of time ?
Had not that been as proper ?
By no means , sir .
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
I'll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
I prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
Who ambles time withal ?
These time ambles withal .
Who doth he gallop withal ?
Who stays it still withal ?
With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
Where dwell you , pretty youth ?
Are you native of this place ?
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
I have been told so of many .
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
I have heard him read many lectures against it , and I thank God I am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
There were none principal .
I prithee , recount some of them .
No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving "Rosalind" on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind .
I am he that is so love-shaked .
I pray you tell me your remedy .
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you .
He taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
What were his marks ?
A lean cheek , which you have not ; a blue eye and sunken , which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit , which you have not ; a beard neglected , which you have not , but I pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue .
Then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation .
But you are no such man .
You are rather point-device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .
Me believe it ?
But , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ?
I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
Did you ever cure any so ?
Yes , one , and in this manner .
I would not be cured , youth .
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
Now , by the faith of my love , I will .
Tell me where it is .
Go with me to it , and I'll show it you ; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
Will you go ?
With all my heart , good youth .
Nay , you must call me Rosalind. , Come , sister , will you go ?
Come apace , good Audrey .
I will fetch up your goats , Audrey .
Doth my simple feature content you ?
Your features , Lord warrant us !
What features ?
Truly , I would the gods had made thee poetical .
I do not know what "poetical" is .
Is it honest in deed and word ?
Is it a true thing ?
No , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
I do , truly , for thou swear'st to me thou art honest .
Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
Would you not have me honest ?
No , truly , unless thou wert hard-favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
Well , I am not fair , and therefore I pray the gods make me honest .
I am not a slut , though I thank the gods I am foul .
Well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
But what though ?
Courage .
Well , that is the dowry of his wife ; 'tis none of his own getting .
Horns ?
Even so .
Poor men alone ?
No , no .
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
Is the single man therefore blessed ?
No .
As a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor .
Here comes Sir Oliver. , Sir Oliver Martext , you are well met .
Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
Is there none here to give the woman ?
I will not take her on gift of any man .
Truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
How do you , sir ?
You are very well met .
God 'ild you for your last company .
I am very glad to see you .
Even a toy in hand here , sir .
Nay , pray be covered .
Will you be married , motley ?
As the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
And will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
Get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
Go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
Come , sweet Audrey .
We must be married , or we must live in bawdry. , Farewell , good Master Oliver , not 'T is no matter .
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
Never talk to me .
I will weep .
Do , I prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
But have I not cause to weep ?
As good cause as one would desire .
Therefore weep .
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
I am heartily glad I came hither to you .
If he come tomorrow , I'll give him his payment .
If ever he go alone again , I'll never wrestle for prize more .
Farewell , good Charles .
But it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all .
You have heard him swear downright he was .
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .
So he laughed and let me go .
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando ?
Oh , that's a brave man .
Who comes here ?
Mistress and master , you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love , Who you saw sitting by me on the turf , Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress .
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
Do not , Phoebe .
Say that you love me not , but say not so In bitterness .
Now counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down ; Or if thou canst not , Oh , for shame , for shame , Lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers .
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
Nor , I am sure , there is no force in eyes That can do hurt .
O dear Phoebe , If ever , as that ever may be near , You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love's keen arrows make .
But till that time Come not thou near me .
And when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , As till that time I shall not pity thee .
But , mistress , know yourself .
Down on your knees And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man's love , For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can ; you are not for all markets .
Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .
So take her to thee , shepherd .
Besides , I like you not .
Will you go , sister ? , Shepherd , ply her hard .
Come , sister. , Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud .
Though all the world could see , None could be so abused in sight as he .
Sweet Phoebe , pity me .
Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
If you do sorrow at my grief in love , By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined .
Thou hast my love .
Is not that neighborly ?
I would have you .
Why , that were covetousness .
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
Think not I love him , though I ask for him .
Tis but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , But what care I for words ?
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
It is a pretty youth , not very pretty , But sure he's proud , and yet his pride becomes him .
He'll make a proper man .
He is not very tall , yet for his years he's tall .
His leg is but so-so , and yet 'tis well .
There was a pretty redness in his lip , A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek : 'twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask .
For what had he to do to chide at me ?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And , now I am remembered , scorned at me .
I marvel why I answered not again .
But that's all one : omittance is no quittance .
I'll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it .
Wilt thou , Silvius ?
Phoebe , with all my heart .
I will be bitter with him and passing short .
Go with me , Silvius .
I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
I am so .
I do love it better than laughing .
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
Why , 'tis good to be sad and say nothing .
Why then , 'tis good to be a post .
I have neither the scholar's melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician's , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier's , which is proud ; nor the soldier's , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer's , which is politic ; nor the lady's , which is nice ; nor the lover's , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
A traveler .
By my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's .
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
Yes , I have gained my experience .
And your experience makes you sad .
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it , too .
Good day and happiness , dear Rosalind .
My fair Rosalind , I come within an hour of my promise .
I pray thee , Rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
Dear Celia , I show more mirth than I am mistress of , and would you yet I were merrier ?
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee .
Well , I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
By mine honor I will , and when I break that oath , let me turn monster .
Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
From henceforth I will , coz , and devise sports .
Let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
Break an hour's promise in love ?
Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
Nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .
I had as lief be wooed of a snail .
Of a snail ?
Besides , he brings his destiny with him .
What's that ?
Why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
Virtue is no hornmaker , and my Rosalind is virtuous .
And I am your Rosalind .
Rosalind of a better leer than you .
Come , woo me , woo me , for now I am in a holiday humor , and like enough to consent .
What would you say to me now , an I were your very , very Rosalind ?
I would kiss before I spoke .
Nay , you were better speak first , and when you were graveled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .
Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking , God warn us , matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
How if the kiss be denied ?
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
Marry , that should you if I were your mistress , or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
Am not I your Rosalind ?
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her .
No , faith , die by attorney .
The poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicet , in a love cause .
Then love me , Rosalind .
Yes , faith , will I , Fridays and Saturdays and all .
And wilt thou have me ?
Ay , and twenty such .
What sayest thou ?
Are you not good ?
I hope so .
Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? , Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
Pray thee , marry us .
I will .
Ay , but when ?
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
Then you must say "I take thee , Rosalind , for wife." I take thee , Rosalind , for wife .
I might ask you for your commission , but I do take thee , Orlando , for my husband .
So do all thoughts .
They are winged .
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
Forever and a day .
Say "a day" without the "ever." No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .
I will weep for nothing , like Diana in the fountain , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry .
I will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
But will my Rosalind do so ?
Oh , but she is wise .
Or else she could not have the wit to do this .
The wiser , the waywarder .
Make the doors upon a woman's wit , and it will out at the casement .
Shut that , and 'twill out at the keyhole .
Stop that , 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
A man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say "Wit , whither wilt ? " Nay , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed .
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue .
Oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
For these two hours , Rosalind , I will leave thee .
I must attend the duke at dinner .
By two o'clock I will be with thee again .
Ay , go your ways , go your ways .
I knew what you would prove .
My friends told me as much , and I thought no less .
Tis but one cast away , and so , come , death .
Two o'clock is your hour ?
Ay , sweet Rosalind .
Therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind .
So , adieu .
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
Adieu .
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate .
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love .
Or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
No , that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep I am in love .
I'll tell thee , Aliena , I can not be out of the sight of Orlando .
I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
And I'll sleep .
Which is he that killed the deer ?
Yes , sir .
Sing it .
Tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
How say you now ?
Is it not past two o'clock ?
And here much Orlando .
Look who comes here .
No , I protest , I know not the contents .
Phoebe did write it .
What shall be our sport , then ?
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
No ?
When Nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by Fortune fall into the fire ?
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
Come , come , you are a fool , And turned into the extremity of love .
I say she never did invent this letter .
This is a man's invention , and his hand .
Sure it is hers .
Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian .
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance .
Will you hear the letter ?
So please you , for I never heard it yet , Yet heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
She Phoebes me .
Mark how the tyrant writes .
That a maiden's heart hath burned ?
Call you this railing ?
Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr'st thou with a woman's heart ?
Not to be endured .
It is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
Orlando doth commend him to you both , And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin .
Are you he ?
Some of my shame , if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stained .
I pray you , tell it .
He threw his eye aside , And mark what object did present itself : Under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched , ragged man , o'ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back .
This seen , Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother , his elder brother .
Oh , I have heard him speak of that same brother , And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men .
But to Orlando : did he leave him there , Food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so , But kindness , nobler ever than revenge , And nature , stronger than his just occasion , Made him give battle to the lioness , Who quickly fell before him ; in which hurtling , From miserable slumber I awaked .
Are you his brother ?
Was 't you he rescued ?
Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
Twas I , but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
But for the bloody napkin ?
By and by .
Brief , I recovered him , bound up his wound , And after some small space , being strong at heart ,
Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
There is more in it. , Cousin Ganymede .
Look , he recovers .
I would I were at home .
We'll lead you thither .
I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
Be of good cheer , youth .
You a man ?
You lack a man's heart .
I do so , I confess it .
Ah , sirrah , a body would think this was well-counterfeited .
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited .
Heigh-ho .
This was not counterfeit .
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
Counterfeit , I assure you .
Well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
So I do .
But i ' faith , I should have been a woman by right .
Come , you look paler and paler .
That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
I shall devise something .
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .
Will you go ?
We shall find a time , Audrey .
Patience , gentle Audrey .
Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman's saying .
A most wicked Sir Oliver , Audrey , a most vile Martext .
But , Audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
Here comes the man you mean .
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
How old are you , friend ?
Five-and-twenty , sir .
A ripe age .
Is thy name William ?
William , sir .
A fair name .
Wast born i ' th ' forest here ?
Ay , sir , I thank God .
Thank God." A good answer .
Art rich ?
Faith , sir , so-so .
So-so" is good , very good , very excellent good .
And yet it is not : it is but so-so .
Art thou wise ?
Ay , sir , I have a pretty wit .
Why , thou sayst well .
Give me your hand .
Art thou learned ?
No , sir .
Then learn this of me : to have is to have .
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink , being poured out of a cup into a glass , by filling the one doth empty the other .
He , sir , that must marry this woman .
Therefore , you clown , abandon , which is , in the vulgar , "leave" , the society , which in the boorish is "company" , of this female , which in the common is "woman" ; which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest ; or , to thy better understanding , diest ; or , to wit , I kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage .
I will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
I will bandy with thee in faction .
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .
Therefore tremble and depart .
Do , good William .
God rest you merry , sir .
Our master and mistress seeks you .
Come away , away .
Trip , Audrey , trip , Audrey. , I attend , I attend .
Mistress , you must come away to your father .
Were you made the messenger ?
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught .
Now , I'll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
Ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
Stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
By our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .
By my knavery ( if I had it ) , then I were .
Is 't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?
It shall be to your good , for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
You have my consent .
Let your wedding be tomorrow .
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers .
Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
And you , fair sister .
O my dear Orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
It is my arm .
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
They are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .
Clubs can not part them .
They shall be married tomorrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial .
But Oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes .
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness , by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
Why , then , tomorrow I can not serve your turn for Rosalind ?
I can live no longer by thinking .
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are .
Believe then , if you please , that I can do strange things .
I have , since I was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her .
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
Speak'st thou in sober meanings ?
By my life I do , which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician .
Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
I care not if I have .
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd .
Good shepherd , tell this youth what 'tis to love .
It is to be all made of sighs and tears , And so am I for Phoebe .
And I for Ganymede .
And I for Rosalind .
And I for no woman .
It is to be all made of faith and service , And so am I for Phoebe .
And I for Ganymede .
And I for Rosalind .
And I for no woman .
It is to be all made of fantasy , All made of passion and all made of wishes , All adoration , duty , and observance , All humbleness , all patience and impatience , All purity , all trial , all observance , And so am I for Phoebe .
And so am I for Rosalind .
And so am I for no woman .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
Why do you speak , too , "Why blame you me to love you ? " ?
To her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
Pray you , no more of this .
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon .
I'll not fail , if I live .
Nor I .
Nor I .
Tomorrow is the joyful day , Audrey .
Tomorrow will we be married .
I do desire it with all my heart , and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
Here comes two of the banished duke's pages .
Well met , honest gentleman .
By my troth , well met .
Come , sit , sit , and a song .
We are for you .
Sit i ' th ' middle .
Shall we clap into 't roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?
I ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
Dost thou believe , Orlando , that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised ?
That would I , had I kingdoms to give with her .
That would I , were I of all kingdoms king .
That will I , should I die the hour after .
But if you do refuse to marry me , You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
So is the bargain .
Though to have her and death were both one thing .
I have promised to make all this matter even .
Keep your word , Phoebe , that you'll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .
Keep your word , Silvius , that you'll marry her If she refuse me .
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favor .
My lord , the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter .
But , my good lord , this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle , Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscured in the circle of this forest .
Good my lord , bid him welcome .
This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest .
He hath been a courtier , he swears .
If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
I have undone three tailors .
I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
And how was that ta'en up ?
Faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
How "seventh cause" ? , Good my lord , like this fellow .
I like him very well .
Prithee , who is 't that thou mean'st ?
One that old Frederick , your father , loves .
My father's love is enough to honor him .
Enough .
Speak no more of him ; you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
With his mouth full of news .
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
Then shall we be news-crammed .
All the better .
We shall be the more marketable. , Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau .
What's the news ?
Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
Sport ?
Of what color ?
God 'ild you , sir .
A poor virgin , sir , an ill-favored thing , sir , but mine own .
By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
But for the seventh cause .
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
Upon a lie seven times removed. , Bear your body more seeming , Audrey. , As thus , sir : I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard .
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was .
This is called "the countercheck quarrelsome , " and so to "the lie circumstantial" and "the lie direct." And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
He's as good at anything and yet a fool .
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things , made even , Atone together .
Good duke , receive thy daughter .
Hymen from heaven brought her , Yea , brought her hither , That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is .
If there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
If there be truth in sight , you are my Rosalind .
If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu .
Peace , ho !
O my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , Even daughter , welcome in no less degree .
Let me have audience for a word or two .
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword .
This to be true I do engage my life .
Sir , by your patience : if I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court .
He hath .
To him will I .
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned .
Stay , Jaques , stay .
To see no pastime I .
What you would have I'll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
Proceed , proceed .
We'll so begin these rites As we do trust they'll end , in true delights .
If it be true that good wine needs no bush , 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .
What color , madam ?
How shall I answer you ?
As wit and fortune will .
You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
Well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
There comes an old man and his three sons , I could match this beginning with an old tale .
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
With bills on their necks : "Be it known unto all men by these presents." The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
So he served the second , and so the third .
Yonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
Alas !
But what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
Why , this that I speak of .
Or I , I promise thee .
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
Shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
Yonder sure they are coming .
Let us now stay and see it .
Come on .
Since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
Is yonder the man ?
Even he , madam .
Alas , he is too young .
Yet he looks successfully .
How now , daughter and cousin ?
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
You will take little delight in it , I can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
In pity of the challenger's youth , I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
Call him hither , good Monsieur Le Beau .
Yonder comes my master , your brother .
Go apart , Adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
I attend them with all respect and duty .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler ?
No , fair princess .
He is the general challenger .
I come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
Young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength .
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
Do , young sir .
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .
I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it I have nothing .
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
And mine , to eke out hers .
Fare you well .
Pray heaven I be deceived in you .
Your heart's desires be with you .
You shall try but one fall .
No , I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
O excellent young man !
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye , I can tell who should down .
No more , no more .
How dost thou , Charles ?
He can not speak , my lord .
Bear him away .
What is thy name , young man ?
Orlando , my liege , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
I would thou hadst been son to some man else .
The world esteemed thy father honorable , But I did find him still mine enemy .
I would thou hadst told me of another father .
Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son , His youngest son , and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick .
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul , And all the world was of my father's mind .
Had I before known this young man his son , I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured .
Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him .
Shall we go , coz ?
Ay. , Fare you well , fair gentleman .
He calls us back .
Will you go , coz ?
Have with you .
Fare you well .
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
I can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee .
Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place .
Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause , and love , Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconsters all that you have done .
The duke is humorous .
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake ; And , on my life , his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth .
Sir , fare you well .
Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
I rest much bounden to you .
Fare you well .
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
But heavenly Rosalind !
Why , Rosalind !
Not one to throw at a dog .
No , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .
Throw some of them at me .
Then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
But is all this for your father ?
No , some of it is for my child's father .
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
Hem them away .
I would try , if I could cry "hem" and have him .
Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
Oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
Oh , a good wish upon you .
The duke my father loved his father dearly .
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
By this kind of chase I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
Yet I hate not Orlando .
No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
Why should I not ?
Doth he not deserve well ?
Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do .
Look , here comes the duke .
With his eyes full of anger .
Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , And get you from our court .
Me , uncle ?
You , cousin .
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
I do beseech your Grace , Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires , If that I do not dream or be not frantic , As I do trust I am not , then , dear uncle , Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness .
Thus do all traitors .
If their purgation did consist in words , They are as innocent as grace itself .
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not .
Thou art thy father's daughter .
There's enough .
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom .
So was I when your Highness banished him .
My father was no traitor .
Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
Dear sovereign , hear me speak .
Ay , Celia , we stayed her for your sake .
I was too young that time to value her , But now I know her .
If she be a traitor , Why so am I .
Thou art a fool .
She robs thee of thy name , And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone .
Then open not thy lips .
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her .
She is banished .
Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
I can not live out of her company .
You are a fool. , You , niece , provide yourself .
If you outstay the time , upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word , you die .
O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
Wilt thou change fathers ?
I will give thee mine .
I charge thee , be not thou more grieved than I am .
I have more cause .
Now , sir , what make you here ?
Nothing .
I am not taught to make anything .
What mar you then , sir ?
Marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
Know you where you are , sir ?
O sir , very well : here in your orchard .
Know you before whom , sir ?
Ay , better than him I am before knows me .
I know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me .
I have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , I confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
Thou hast not , cousin .
Prithee , be cheerful .
Know'st thou not the duke Hath banished me , his daughter ?
That he hath not .
No , hath not ?
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one .
Shall we be sundered ?
Shall we part , sweet girl ?
For , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , Say what thou canst , I'll go along with thee .
Why , whither shall we go ?
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden .
Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far ?
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face .
Were it not better , Because that I am more than common tall , That I did suit me all points like a man ?
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh , A boar-spear in my hand , and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will , We'll have a swashing and a martial outside , As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances .
What shall I call thee when thou art a man ?
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page , And therefore look you call me Ganymede .
But what will you be called ?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
Leave me alone to woo him .
Let's away And get our jewels and our wealth together , Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight .
Now go we in content To liberty , and not to banishment .
Now , my co-mates and brothers in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ?
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am." Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head .
And this our life , exempt from public haunt , Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .
I would not change it .
Happy is your Grace , That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style .
Come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
And indeed , my lord , The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting , and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase .
And did you leave him in this contemplation ?
We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
Show me the place .
I love to cope him in these sullen fits , For then he's full of matter .
I'll bring you to him straight .
Can it be possible that no man saw them ?
It can not be .
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this .
I can not hear of any that did see her .
The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
My lord , the roinish clown , at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh , is also missing .
Send to his brother .
Fetch that gallant hither .
If he be absent , bring his brother to me .
I'll make him find him .
Do this suddenly , And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways .
Who's there ?
Why , what make you here ?
Why are you virtuous ?
Why do people love you ?
And wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
Know you not , master , to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies ?
Oh , what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it !
Why , what's the matter ?
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives .
Your brother , no , no brother , yet the son , Yet not the son , I will not call him son , Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises , and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie , And you within it .
If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off .
I overheard him and his practices .
This is no place , this house is but a butchery .
Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
Why , whither , Adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
No matter whither , so you come not here .
What , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road ?
Yet this I will not do , do how I can .
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
But do not so .
Let me be your servant .
Though I look old , yet I am strong and lusty , For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility .
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty but kindly .
Let me go with you .
I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities .
O good old man , how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world , When service sweat for duty , not for meed .
But come thy ways .
We'll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We'll light upon some settled low content .
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I , but now live here no more .
At seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , But at fourscore , it is too late a week .
Yet fortune can not recompense me better Than to die well , and not my master's debtor .
O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
I can not go no further .
For my part , I had rather bear with you than bear you .
Ay , now am I in Arden , the more fool I .
Ay , be so , good Touchstone .
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
Wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
I am no villain .
Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .
Thou hast railed on thyself .
Sweet masters , be patient .
For your father's remembrance , be at accord .
Let me go , I say .
I will not till I please .
You shall hear me .
My father charged you in his will to give me good education .
You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
The spirit of my father grows strong in me , and I will no longer endure it .
And what wilt thou do , beg when that is spent ?
Well , sir , get you in .
I will not long be troubled with you .
You shall have some part of your will .
I pray you leave me .
That is the way to make her scorn you still .
O Corin , that thou knew'st how I do love her !
I partly guess , for I have loved ere now .
No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .
But if thy love were ever like to mine , As sure I think did never man love so , How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
Oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved .
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now , Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress's praise , Thou hast not loved .
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved .
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
And I mine .
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile .
And I remember the kissing of her batler , and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked .
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom I took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , "Wear these for my sake." We that are true lovers run into strange capers .
But as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of .
Nay , I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it .
Jove , Jove , this shepherd's passion Is much upon my fashion .
And mine , but it grows something stale with me .
I pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .
Peace , fool .
He's not thy kinsman .
Who calls ?
Your betters , sir .
I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .
Fair sir , I pity her And wish , for her sake more than for mine own , My fortunes were more able to relieve her .
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze .
Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on .
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile , That little cares for buying anything .
I pray thee , if it stand with honesty , Buy thou the cottage , pasture , and the flock , And thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
And we will mend thy wages .
Assuredly the thing is to be sold .
Go with me .
If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
More , more , I prithee , more .
It will make you melancholy , Monsieur Jaques .
I thank it .
More , I prithee , more .
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .
More , I prithee , more .
My voice is ragged .
I know I can not please you .
Come , more , another stanzo .
Nay , I care not for their names .
Well then , if ever I thank any man , I'll thank you .
But that they call "compliment" is like th ' encounter of two dog- apes .
Well , I'll end the song. , Sirs , cover the while ; the duke will drink under this tree. , He hath been all this day to look you .
And I have been all this day to avoid him .
He is too disputable for my company .
I think of as many matters as he , but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
Come , warble , come .
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention .
Dear master , I can go no further .
Oh , I die for food .
Here lie I down and measure out my grave .
Farewell , kind master .
Why , how now , Adam ?
No greater heart in thee ?
Live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
I will here be with thee presently , and if I bring thee not something to eat , I will give thee leave to die .
But if thou diest before I come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
Well said .
Thou look'st cheerly , and I'll be with thee quickly .
Yet thou liest in the bleak air .
Cheerly , good Adam .
I think he be transformed into a beast , For I can nowhere find him like a man .
My lord , he is but even now gone hence .
Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
Go seek him .
Tell him I would speak with him .
He saves my labor by his own approach .
Why , how now , monsieur ?
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company ?
What , you look merrily .
And then he drew a dial from his poke And , looking on it with lackluster eye , Says very wisely , "It is ten o'clock .
Thus we may see , " quoth he , "how the world wags .
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more 'twill be eleven .
O noble fool !
A worthy fool !
Motley's the only wear .
What fool is this ?
Oh , that I were a fool !
God be with my old master .
He would not have spoke such a word .
Is it even so ?
Begin you to grow upon me ?
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither. , Holla , Dennis !
Calls your Worship ?
Was not Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
Call him in .
Twill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
I must have liberty Withal , as large a charter as the wind , To blow on whom I please , for so fools have .
And they that are most galled with my folly , They most must laugh .
And why , sir , must they so ?
The "why" is plain as way to parish church : He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob .
Invest me in my motley .
Give me leave To speak my mind , and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th ' infected world , If they will patiently receive my medicine .
Fie on thee !
I can tell what thou wouldst do .
What , for a counter , would I do but good ?
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , For thou thyself hast been a libertine , As sensual as the brutish sting itself , And all th ' embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbor ?
Forbear , and eat no more .
Why , I have eat none yet .
Nor shalt not till necessity be served .
Of what kind should this cock come of ?
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?
You touched my vein at first .
But forbear , I say .
An you will not be answered with reason , I must die .
What would you have ?
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
Speak you so gently ?
Pardon me , I pray you .
I thought that all things had been savage here , And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment .
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church , And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles , like a doe , I go to find my fawn And give it food .
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love .
I thank you ; and be blessed for your good comfort .
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
All the world's a stage , And all the men and women merely players .
They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages .
At first the infant , Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms .
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face , creeping like snail Unwillingly to school .
And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances ; And so he plays his part .
Welcome .
Set down your venerable burden , And let him feed .
I thank you most for him .
Welcome .
Fall to .
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes. , Give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
As if time were in debt .
How fondly dost thou reason !
Bear it straight , And bring thy master home immediately .
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend , And every one doth call me by my name .
Some tender money to me ; some invite me ; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; Some offer me commodities to buy .
Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me , And therewithal took measure of my body .
Sure , these are but imaginary wiles , And lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
Master , here's The gold you sent me for .
What Adam dost thou mean ?
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise , but that Adam that keeps the prison ; he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
I understand thee not .
No ?
What , thou meanest an officer ?
Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says "God give you good rest." Well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
Is there any ships put forth tonight ?
May we be gone ?
Some blessed power deliver us from hence !
Well met , well met , Master Antipholus .
I see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .
Is that the chain you promised me today ?
Satan , avoid !
I charge thee , tempt me not .
Master , is this Mistress Satan ?
It is the devil .
Nay , she is worse ; she is the devil's dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
Light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .
Your man and you are marvelous merry , sir .
Will you go with me ?
We'll mend our dinner here .
Master , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
Why , Dromio ?
I pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
Avaunt , thou witch ! , Come , Dromio , let us go .
Mistress , that you know .
Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad ; Else would he never so demean himself .
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain .
Both one and other he denies me now .
The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
Belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , On purpose shut the doors against his way .
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away .
This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men .
But though thou art adjudged to the death , And passed sentence may not be recalled But to our honour's great disparagement , Yet will I favor thee in what I can .
Therefore , merchant , I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help .
I will , my lord .
Fear me not , man .
I tell you , 'twill sound harshly in her ears .
Here comes my man .
I think he brings the money .
How now , sir ?
Have you that I sent you for ?
Here's that , I warrant you , will pay them all .
But where's the money ?
Why , sir , I gave the money for the rope .
I'll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
To a rope's end , sir , and to that end am I returned .
And to that end , sir , I will welcome you .
Good sir , be patient .
Good now , hold thy tongue .
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
Nay , I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door .
Come , go along .
My wife is coming yonder .
Mistress , Wilt thou still talk ?
How say you now ?
Is not your husband mad ?
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven .
Peace , doting wizard , peace .
I am not mad .
O , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
You minion , you , are these your customers ?
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house ?
Dined at home" ?
Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
Sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out ?
Perdie , your doors were locked , and you shut out .
And did not she herself revile me there ?
Sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
Did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
And did not I in rage depart from thence ?
In verity you did. , My bones bear witness , That since have felt the vigour of his rage .
It is no shame .
Alas , I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
Money by me !
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
He came to me , and I delivered it .
And I am witness with her that she did .
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
Mistress , both man and master is possessed .
I know it by their pale and deadly looks .
They must be bound and laid in some dark room .
I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
And , gentle master , I received no gold .
But I confess , sir , that we were locked out .
Let him not come near me .
More company !
The fiend is strong within him .
What , will you murder me ? , Thou jailer , thou , I am thy prisoner .
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue ?
Masters , let him go .
He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
Go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
He is my prisoner .
If I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee .
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it. , Good Master Doctor , see him safe conveyed Home to my house .
O most unhappy day !
O most unhappy strumpet !
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
How idly do they talk !
One Angelo , a goldsmith .
Do you know him ?
I know the man .
Two hundred ducats .
Say , how grows it due ?
Due for a chain your husband had of him .
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
I long to know the truth hereof at large .
God for Thy mercy , they are loose again !
And come with naked swords .
Let's call more help To have them bound again .
Away !
They'll kill us .
I see these witches are afraid of swords .
She that would be your wife now ran from you .
I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
Faith , stay here this night .
They will surely do us no harm .
You saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
that claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still , and turn witch .
I will not stay tonight for all the town .
Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
How is the man esteemed here in the city ?
His word might bear my wealth at any time .
Speak softly .
Tis so ; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have .
Good sir , draw near to me .
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
There is your money that I had to keep .
Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee .
Within this hour it will be dinnertime .
Till that , I'll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary .
Get thee away .
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed , having so good a mean .
A trusty villain , sir , that very oft , When I am dull with care and melancholy , Lightens my humor with his merry jests .
What , will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me ?
I think I had .
I never did deny it .
Yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
These ears of mine , thou know'st did hear thee .
Fie on thee , wretch .
Tis pity that thou liv'st To walk where any honest men resort .
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus .
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand .
I dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
Run , master , run .
For God's sake , take a house .
This is some priory .
In , or we are spoiled .
Be quiet , people .
Wherefore throng you hither ?
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
How long hath this possession held the man ?
This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was .
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
Hath not else his eye Stray'd his affection in unlawful love , A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing ?
Which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
You should for that have reprehended him .
Why , so I did .
Ay , but not rough enough .
Haply in private .
And in assemblies too .
Ay , but not enough .
Alone , it was the subject of my theme ; In company I often glanced it .
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad .
And thereof came it that the man was mad .
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth .
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .
In food , in sport , and life-preserving rest To be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .
The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
Good people , enter and lay hold on him .
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order .
Therefore depart and leave him here with me .
Be quiet and depart .
Thou shalt not have him .
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity .
Come , go .
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess .
By this , I think , the dial points at five .
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant , Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town , Beheaded publicly for his offense .
See where they come .
We will behold his death .
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die ; so much we tender him .
Justice , most sacred duke , against the Abbess .
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
It can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
Therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
Long since thy husband served me in my wars , And I to thee engaged a prince's word , When thou didst make him master of thy bed , To do him all the grace and good I could .
Peace , fool .
Thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
Mistress , upon my life I tell you true .
I have not breathed almost since I did see it .
He cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , To scorch your face and to disfigure you .
Ay me , it is my husband .
Witness you That he is borne about invisible .
Even now we housed him in the abbey here , And now he's there , past thought of human reason .
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house .
A grievous fault. , Say , woman , didst thou so ?
No , my good lord .
Myself , he , and my sister Today did dine together .
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal .
Ne'er may I look on day , nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth .
O perjured woman !
My liege , I am advised what I say , Neither disturbed with the effect of wine , Nor heady-rash , provoked with raging ire , Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
That goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , Could witness it , for he was with me then , Who parted with me to go fetch a chain , Promising to bring it to the Porpentine , Where Balthasar and I did dine together .
Our dinner done and he not coming thither , I went to seek him .
In the street I met him , And in his company that gentleman .
By th ' way we met My wife , her sister , and a rabble more Of vile confederates .
Along with them They brought one Pinch , a hungry , lean-faced villain , A mere anatomy , a mountebank , A threadbare juggler , and a fortune-teller , A needy , hollow-eyed , sharp-looking wretch , A living dead man .
This pernicious slave , Forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , And , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
He had , my lord , and when he ran in here , These people saw the chain about his neck .
I never saw the chain , so help me heaven , And this is false you burden me withal .
Why , what an intricate impeach is this !
Soon at five o'clock , Please you , I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime .
My present business calls me from you now .
Farewell till then .
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city .
Sir , I commend you to your own content .
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I can not get .
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop , Who , falling there to find his fellow forth , Unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .
So I , to find a mother and a brother , In quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
How chance thou art returned so soon ?
Returned so soon ?
Rather approach'd too late !
The capon burns ; the pig falls from the spit ; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; My mistress made it one upon my cheek .
You say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here Denies that saying .
Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
He did , and from my finger snatched that ring .
Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
As sure , my liege , as I do see your Grace .
I think you are all mated or stark mad .
Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnawed in two my cords .
Now am I Dromio , and his man , unbound .
I am sure you both of you remember me .
You are not Pinch's patient , are you , sir ?
Why look you strange on me ?
you know me well .
I never saw you in my life till now .
O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face .
But tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
Neither .
Dromio , nor thou ?
No , trust me , sir , nor I. I am sure thou dost .
Not know my voice !
O time's extremity , Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear .
All these old witnesses , I can not err , Tell me thou art my son Antipholus .
I never saw my father in my life .
But seven years since , in Syracusa , boy , Thou know'st we parted .
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
Most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
I , sir , am Dromio .
Command him away .
I , sir , am Dromio .
Please , let me stay .
O , my old master. , Who hath bound him here ?
Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty. , Speak , old Egeon , if thou be'st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia , That bore thee at a burden two fair sons .
O , if thou be'st the same Egeon , speak , And speak unto the same Emilia .
Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together .
If I dream not , thou art Emilia .
If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
Corinth first .
Stay , stand apart .
I know not which is which .
I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord .
And I with him .
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
Which of you two did dine with me today ?
I , gentle mistress .
And are not you my husband ?
That is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
I think it be , sir .
I deny it not .
And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
I think I did , sir .
I deny it not .
I sent you money , sir , to be your bail By Dromio , but I think he brought it not .
No , none by me .
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me .
These ducats pawn I for my father here .
It shall not need .
Thy father hath his life .
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
Renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffered wrong .
Go , keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction. , Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons , and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered. , The Duke , my husband , and my children both , And you , the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast , and go with me .
After so long grief , such nativity !
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast .
Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur .
He speaks to me. , I am your master , Dromio .
There is a fat friend at your master's house That kitchened me for you today at dinner .
She now shall be my sister , not my wife .
Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth .
Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
Not I , sir .
You are my elder .
That's a question .
How shall we try it ?
We'll draw cuts for the signior .
Till then , lead thou first .
Nay , then , thus : We came into the world like brother and brother , And now let's go hand in hand , not one before another .
Stop in your wind , sir .
Tell me this , I pray : Where have you left the money that I gave you ?
O , sixpence , that I had o ' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
The saddler had it , sir ; I kept it not .
I am not in a sportive humor now .
Tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
We being strangers here , how dar'st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody ?
I pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger .
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee ?
To me , sir ?
Why , you gave no gold to me !
Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner .
My mistress and her sister stays for you .
Now , as I am a Christian , answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money , Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed .
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
Thy mistress ' marks ?
what mistress , slave , hast thou ?
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid ?
There , take you that , sir knave .
What mean you , sir ?
For God's sake , hold your hands .
Nay , an you will not , sir , I'll take my heels .
Upon my life , by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money .
They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin .
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master ?
Sure , Luciana , it is two o'clock .
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner .
Good sister , let us dine and never fret .
A man is master of his liberty ; Time is their master , and when they see time They'll go or come .
If so , be patient , sister .
Why should their liberty than ours be more ?
Because their business still lies out o ' door .
Why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
Then let your will attend on their accords .
This servitude makes you to keep unwed .
Not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
Ere I learn love , I'll practice to obey .
How if your husband start some otherwhere ?
Till he come home again , I would forbear .
Patience unmoved !
No marvel though she pause ; They can be meek that have no other cause .
A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain .
So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me ; But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begged patience in thee will be left .
Well , I will marry one day , but to try .
Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
Know'st thou his mind ?
But say , I prithee , is he coming home ?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife .
Why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
Horn mad , thou villain !
I mean not cuckold mad , But sure he is stark mad .
My mistress , sir , " quoth I .
Hang up thy mistress !
Quoth my master .
I know , " quoth he , "no house , no wife , no mistress." So that my errand , due unto my tongue , I thank him , I bare home upon my shoulders , For , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
Go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
Go back again and be new beaten home ?
For God's sake , send some other messenger .
Back , slave , or I will break thy pate across .
Hence , prating peasant !
Fetch thy master home .
You spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither .
If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look .
Hath homely age th ' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek ?
Barren my wit ?
My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair .
But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home .
Poor I am but his stale .
Self-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here ?
Sister , you know he promised me a chain .
Would that alone o ' love he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
I see the jewel best enameled Will lose his beauty .
Yet the gold bides still That others touch , and often touching will Wear gold ; yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
Since that my beauty can not please his eye , I'll weep what's left away , and weeping die .
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall , And by the doom of death end woes and all .
For , since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns .
Nay , more , if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs ; Again , if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus , he dies , His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose , Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him .
Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Can not amount unto a hundred marks ; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
By computation and mine host's report , I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart .
See , here he comes .
How now , sir ?
is your merry humor altered ?
You know no Centaur ?
You received no gold ?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
My house was at the Phoenix ?
Wast thou mad , That thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
What answer , sir ?
When spake I such a word ?
I did not see you since you sent me hence , Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
Villain , thou didst deny the gold's receipt And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner , For which , I hope , thou felt'st I was displeased .
I am glad to see you in this merry vein .
What means this jest ?
I pray you , master , tell me ?
Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
Think'st thou I jest ?
Hold , take thou that and that .
Hold , sir , for God's sake !
Now your jest is earnest .
Upon what bargain do you give it me ?
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours .
Sconce" call you it ?
Shall I tell you why ?
Well , sir , I thank you .
Marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
I'll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
But say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
In good time , sir , what's that ?
Basting .
Well , sir , then 'twill be dry .
If it be , sir , I pray you , eat none of it .
Your reason ?
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
Well , sir , learn to jest in good time .
There's a time for all things .
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric .
By what rule , sir ?
Marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself .
Let's hear it .
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
Why is Time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
Why , but there's many a man hath more hair than wit .
Why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
For what reason ?
For two , and sound ones too .
Nay , not sound , I pray you .
Sure ones , then .
Nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
Certain ones , then .
Name them .
The one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
Thus I mend it : Time himself is bald and therefore , to the world's end , will have bald followers .
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear , That never object pleasing in thine eye , That never touch well welcome to thy hand , That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste , Unless I spake , or looked , or touched , or carved to thee .
How comes it now , my husband , O , how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself ?
Ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
I know you not .
When were you wont to use my sister thus ?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner .
By Dromio ?
By thee ; and this thou didst return from him : That he did buffet thee and , in his blows , Denied my house for his , me for his wife .
Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
What is the course and drift of your compact ?
I , sir ?
I never saw her till this time .
Villain , thou liest ; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
I never spake with her in all my life .
What , was I married to her in my dream ?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
Until I know this sure uncertainty I'll entertain the offered fallacy .
Dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
O , for my beads !
I cross me for a sinner .
This is the fairy land .
O spite of spites !
We talk with goblins , owls , and sprites : If we obey them not , this will ensue : They'll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not ?
Dromio , thou , Dromio , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
I am transformed , master , am I not ?
I think thou art in mind , and so am I. Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
Tis true .
I am an ass ; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
Come , sir , to dinner. , Dromio , keep the gate .
Husband , I'll dine above with you today , And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
Am I in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
Known unto these , and to myself disguised !
Master , shall I be porter at the gate ?
Ay ; and let none enter , lest I break your pate .
Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
In Syracusa was I born , and wed Unto a woman happy but for me , And by me , had not our hap been bad .
That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden , male twins , both alike .
Unwilling , I agreed .
Alas , too soon We came aboard .
Good Signior Angelo , you must excuse us all ; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours .
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet , And that tomorrow you will bring it home .
But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart , and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold , And that I did deny my wife and house. , Thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know .
I think thou art an ass .
You're sad , Signior Balthasar .
I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
Good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
And welcome more common , for that's nothing but words .
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
Ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
But though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
Better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
But soft !
My door is lock'd .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
My master stays in the street .
Who talks within there ?
Ho , open the door .
Wherefore ?
For my dinner .
I have not dined today .
What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe ?
O villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
O Lord , I must laugh .
Have at you with a proverb : shall I set in my staff ?
Do you hear , you minion ?
You'll let us in , I hope ?
So , come , help .
Well struck !
There was blow for blow .
Thou baggage , let me in .
Master , knock the door hard .
You'll cry for this , minion , if I beat the door down .
Are you there , wife ?
You might have come before .
If you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
In debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
Go , fetch me something : I'll break ope the gate .
Here's too much "out upon thee ! " I pray thee , let me in .
Well , I'll break in .
Go , borrow me a crow .
A crow without feather ?
Master , mean you so ?
For a fish without a fin , there's a fowl without a feather. , Go , get thee gone .
Fetch me an iron crow .
Have patience , sir .
O , let it not be so .
And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you .
Be ruled by me ; depart in patience , And let us to the Tiger all to dinner , And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint .
You have prevailed .
I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .
There will we dine .
That chain will I bestow , Be it for nothing but to spite my wife , Upon mine hostess there .
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence .
Do so .
This jest shall cost me some expense .
Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth , Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness .
What simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board .
Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; We in your motion turn , and you may move us .
Then , gentle brother , get you in again .
Sweet mistress , what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth's wonder , more than earth divine .
Teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak .
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field ?
Are you a god ?
would you create me new ?
Transform me , then , and to your power I'll yield .
But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe .
Far more , far more , to you do I decline .
O , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears .
What , are you mad that you do reason so ?
It is a fault that springeth from your eye .
For gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
Why call you me "love" ?
Call my sister so .
Thy sister's sister .
That's my sister .
No , It is thyself , mine own self's better part , Mine eye's clear eye , my dear heart's dearer heart , My food , my fortune , and my sweet hope's aim , My sole earth's heaven , and my heaven's claim .
All this my sister is , or else should be .
Call thyself "sister , " sweet , for I am thee .
Give me thy hand .
O soft , sir !
Hold you still .
I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
Why , how now , Dromio .
Where runn'st thou so fast ?
Do you know me , sir ?
Am I Dromio ?
Am I your man ?
Am I myself ?
The children thus disposed , my wife and I , Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And , floating straight , obedient to the stream , Was carried towards Corinth , as we thought .
But ere they came , -O , let me say no more !
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
I am an ass , I am a woman's man , and besides myself .
What woman's man ?
And how besides thyself ?
What claim lays she to thee ?
What is she ?
Marry , sir , she's the kitchen wench , and all grease , and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light .
I warrant her rags and the
If she lives till doomsday , she'll burn a week longer than the whole world .
What complexion is she of ?
Swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
That's a fault that water will mend .
No , sir , 'tis in grain ; Noah's flood could not do it .
What's her name ?
Then she bears some breadth ?
She is spherical , like a globe .
In what part of her body stands Ireland ?
Marry , sir , in her buttocks .
Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
Where America , the Indies ?
O , sir , upon her nose , all o'er-embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain , who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose .
And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
An if the wind blow any way from shore , I will not harbor in this town tonight .
If any bark put forth , come to the mart , Where I will walk till thou return to me .
If every one knows us , and we know none , 'T is time , I think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
There's none but witches do inhabit here , And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence .
She that doth call me husband , even my soul Doth for a wife abhor .
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong , I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song .
I know it well , sir .
Lo , here's the chain .
What is your will that I shall do with this ?
I have made it for you .
Made it for me , sir ?
I bespoke it not .
Not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .
You are a merry man , sir .
Fare you well .
What I should think of this I can not tell , But this I think : there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain .
I'll to the mart , and there for Dromio stay .
If any ship put out , then straight away .
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus .
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same .
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house , I will discharge my bond and thank you too .
Saving your merry humor , here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , The fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman .
I pray you , see him presently discharged , For he is bound to sea , and stays but for it .
I am not furnished with the present money .
Besides , I have some business in the town .
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
Well , sir , I will .
Have you the chain about you ?
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain .
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
Good Lord !
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine .
I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
The hour steals on .
I pray you , sir , dispatch .
You hear how he importunes me .
The chain !
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
Come , come .
You know I gave it you even now .
Either send the chain , or send me by some token .
Fie , now you run this humor out of breath .
Come , where's the chain ?
I pray you , let me see it .
I answer you ?
What should I answer you ?
The money that you owe me for the chain .
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
You know I gave it you half an hour since .
You wrong me more , sir , in denying it .
Consider how it stands upon my credit .
Well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
I do , This touches me in reputation .
Consent to pay thee that I never had ? , Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou dar'st .
Here is thy fee .
Arrest him , officer .
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently .
I do arrest you , sir .
You hear the suit .
I do obey thee till I give thee bail .
But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame , I doubt it not .
Nay , forward , old man .
Do not break off so , For we may pity though not pardon thee .
O , had the gods done so , I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us .
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss ; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now .
Our fraughtage , sir , I have conveyed aboard , and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae .
Why , thou peevish sheep , What ship of Epidamnum stays for me ?
A ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
Thou drunken slave , I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end .
You sent me for a rope's end as soon .
You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed .
To Adriana , villain , hie thee straight .
Give her this key , and tell her in the desk That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats .
Let her send it .
Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me .
Hie thee , slave .
Begone. , On , officer , to prison till it come .
To Adriana .
That is where we dined , Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband .
She is too big , I hope , for me to compass .
Thither I must , although against my will , For servants must their masters ' minds fulfill .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
Looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
First he denied you had in him no right .
He meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
Then pleaded I for you .
And what said he ?
That love i begged for you he begged of me .
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
Have patience , I beseech .
Who would be jealous , then , of such a one ?
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
How hast thou lost thy breath ?
By running fast .
Where is thy master , Dromio ?
Is he well ?
No , he's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell .
The passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
Why , man , what is the matter ?
Tell me at whose suit .
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well , But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him ; that can I tell .
Go fetch it , sister .
This I wonder at , That he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
Do you not hear it ring ?
What , the chain ?
No , no , the bell .
Tis time that I were gone .
It was two ere I left him , and now the clock strikes one .
That did I never hear .
Excellent well .
You are a fishmonger .
Not I , my lord .
Then I would you were so honest a man .
Honest , my lord ?
Ay , sir .
To be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
That's very true , my lord .
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion , Have you a daughter ?
I have , my lord .
Let her not walk i ' th ' sun .
Conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive , Friend , look to 't .
Words , words , words .
What is the matter , my lord ?
Between who ?
I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
Slanders , sir .
Into my grave .
Indeed , that is out of the air .
You can not , sir , take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal , except my life , except my life , except my life .
Fare you well , my lord .
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet .
There he is .
God save you , sir !
My honored lord !
My most dear lord !
My excellent good friends !
How dost thou , Guildenstern ?
Ah , Rosencrantz !
Good lads , how do you both ?
Happy , in that we are not overhappy .
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button .
Then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
Faith , her privates we .
What news ?
But your news is not true .
Let me question more in particular .
What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
Prison , my lord ?
Denmark's a prison .
Then is the world one .
A goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , Denmark being one o ' th ' worst .
We think not so , my lord .
Why , then , 'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
To me it is a prison .
Why then , your ambition makes it one .
Tis too narrow for your mind .
Which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
A dream itself is but a shadow .
Truly , and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow .
Then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
Shall we to th ' court ?
Beggar that I am , I am even poor in thanks ; but I thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
Is it your own inclining ?
What should we say , my lord ?
You were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color .
I know the good king and queen have sent for you .
To what end , my lord ?
That you must teach me .
My lord , we were sent for .
What might be toward , that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?
Who is 't that can inform me ?
That can I .
I will tell you why .
Why did you laugh then , when I said "man delights not me" ?
He that plays the king shall be welcome .
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o ' th ' sear , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for 't .
What players are they ?
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
How chances it they travel ?
Their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city ?
Are they so followed ?
No , indeed are they not .
How comes it ?
Do they grow rusty ?
Nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
But there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't .
These are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages , so they call them , that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .
What , are they children ?
Who maintains 'em ?
How are they escoted ?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
Will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
Faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .
There was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
Is 't possible ?
Oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
Do the boys carry it away ?
It is not very strange .
For my uncle is King of Denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
Sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
There are the players .
Gentlemen , you are welcome to Elsinore .
Your hands , come then .
Let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
You are welcome .
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .
In what , my dear lord ?
I am but mad north-north-west .
When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
Well be with you , gentlemen .
Hark you , Guildenstern , and you too , at each ear a hearer .
Happily he's the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
When Roscius was an actor in Rome , The actors are come hither , my lord .
Buzz , buzz .
Upon my honor , Then came each actor on his ass ,
Why , Am I not i ' th ' right , old Jephthah ?
If you call me Jephthah , my lord , I have a daughter that I love passing well .
What follows , then , my lord ?
Why ,
You are welcome , masters , welcome , all ! , I am glad to see thee well. , Welcome , good friends. , O old friend ?
What speech , my good lord ?
But it was , as I received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine , an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
One speech in it I chiefly loved .
This is too long .
It shall to the barber's , with your beard. , Prithee , say on .
The mobled queen" ?
That's good .
Mobled queen" is good .
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in 's eyes. , Prithee , no more .
My lord , I will use them according to their desert .
God's bodykins , man , much better .
Use them after your own honor and dignity .
The less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
Take them in .
Come , sirs .
Follow him , friends .
We'll hear a play tomorrow .
Ay , my lord .
We'll ha 't tomorrow night .
You could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in 't , could you not ?
Ay , my lord .
Very well .
Follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
My good friends , I'll leave you till night .
You are welcome to Elsinore .
Good my lord .
Now I am alone .
Oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am I !
And all for nothing , For Hecuba !
And terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands So by his father lost .
In the most high and palmy state of Rome , A little ere the mightiest Julius fell , The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , Disasters in the sun , and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
But soft , behold !
Lo , where it comes again .
I'll cross it though it blast me. , Stay , illusion !
If thou hast any sound or use of voice , Speak to me .
Am I a coward ?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
Tweaks me by the nose ?
Who does me this ?
Bloody , bawdy villain !
Remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
O vengeance !
Why , what an ass am I !
Fie upon 't , foh !
For murder , though it have no tongue , will speak With most miraculous organ .
If he do blench , I know my course .
I'll have grounds More relative than this .
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king .
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
Did he receive you well ?
Most like a gentleman .
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply .
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o'erraught on the way .
They are about the court , And , as I think , they have already order This night to play before him .
Tis most true , And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined .
Good gentlemen , give him a further edge , And drive his purpose on to these delights .
We shall , my lord .
I shall obey you .
Madam , I wish it may .
Ophelia , walk you here .
Let's withdraw , my lord .
To die , to sleep , No more , and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to , 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished !
To die , to sleep .
There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life .
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , Th ' oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , The pangs of despised love , the law's delay , The insolence of office , and the spurns That patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin ?
Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of ?
Good my lord , How does your honor for this many a day ?
I humbly thank you .
Well , well , well .
My lord , I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver .
I pray you now receive them .
There , my lord .
Ha , ha , are you honest ?
My lord ?
Are you fair ?
What means your lordship ?
That if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
Could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
Ay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .
This was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
I did love you once .
Indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
I loved you not .
I was the more deceived .
Get thee to a nunnery .
I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven ?
We are arrant knaves , all .
Believe none of us .
Go thy ways to a nunnery .
Where's your father ?
At home , my lord .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house .
Farewell .
O , help him , you sweet heavens !
Get thee to a nunnery , go .
Farewell .
Farewell .
Heavenly powers , restore him !
I have heard of your paintings too , well enough .
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
You jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
Go to , I'll no more on 't .
It hath made me mad .
I say , we will have no more marriages .
Those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
The rest shall keep as they are .
To a nunnery , go .
Love ?
His affections do not that way tend .
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart , Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself .
What think you on 't ?
It shall do well .
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. , How now , Ophelia ?
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
Let her be round with him , And I'll be placed , so please you , in the ear Of all their conference .
If she find him not , To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think .
It shall be so .
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me , Speak to me .
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth , For which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , Speak of it .
Stay and speak !
Stop it , Marcellus .
Shall I strike at it with my partisan ?
Do , if it will not stand .
Tis here .
Tis here .
Tis gone .
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
Speak the speech , I pray you , as I pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant .
Pray you , avoid it .
I warrant your honor .
Be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
O , reform it altogether !
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
And the queen too , and that presently .
Bid the players make haste .
Will you two help to hasten them ?
Ay , my lord .
What ho , Horatio !
Here , sweet lord , at your service .
Horatio , thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal .
O my dear lord , Nay , do not think I flatter .
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ?
Why should the poor be flattered ?
No , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning .
Dost thou hear ?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been , As one in suffering all that suffers nothing , A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks .
Give him heedful note .
They are coming to the play .
I must be idle .
Get you a place .
How fares our cousin Hamlet ?
Excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon's dish .
I eat the air , promise-crammed .
You can not feed capons so .
I have nothing with this answer , Hamlet .
These words are not mine .
No , nor mine now .
That did I , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
What did you enact ?
I did enact Julius Caesar .
I was killed i ' th ' Capitol .
Brutus killed me .
Ay , my lord .
They stay upon your patience .
No , good mother .
Here's metal more attractive .
Lady , shall I lie in your lap ?
No , my lord .
I mean , my head upon your lap ?
Ay , my lord .
Do you think I meant country matters ?
What is , my lord ?
Nothing .
You are merry , my lord .
Who , I ?
Ay , my lord .
O God , your only jig-maker .
What should a man do but be merry ?
For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
Nay , 'tis twice two months , my lord .
So long ?
Nay then , let the devil wear black , for I'll have a suit of sables .
Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year .
But , by 'r Lady , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby-horse , whose epitaph is "For , oh , for , oh , the hobby-horse is forgot." What means this , my lord ?
Marry , this is miching
Belike this show imports the argument of the play .
We shall know by this fellow .
The players can not keep counsel .
They'll tell all .
Will he tell us what this show meant ?
Ay , or any show that you will show him .
Be not you ashamed to show , he'll not shame to tell you what it means .
You are naught , you are naught .
I'll mark the play .
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring ?
Tis brief , my lord .
As woman's love .
Madam , how like you this play ?
The lady protests too much , methinks .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
Is there no offense in 't ?
No offense i ' th ' world .
What do you call the play ?
It faded on the crowing of the cock .
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
I could interpret between you and your love , if I could see the puppets dallying .
Come , "The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge , "
The story is extant , and writ in choice Italian .
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife .
The king rises .
What , frighted with false fire ?
How fares my lord ?
Give me some light , away !
Lights , lights , lights !
A whole one , I .
Didst perceive ?
Very well , my lord .
Upon the talk of the poisoning ?
I did very well note him .
Ah ha !
Come , some music !
Come , the recorders !
Come , some music !
Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
Sir , a whole history .
The king , sir , Ay , sir , what of him ?
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
I am tame , sir .
Pronounce .
The queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
You are welcome .
Nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , I will do your mother's commandment .
If not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
Sir , I can not .
What , my lord ?
Make you a wholesome answer .
My wit's diseased .
Therefore no more but to the matter .
O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother !
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration ?
Impart .
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
We shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
Have you any further trade with us ?
My lord , you once did love me .
And do still , by these pickers and stealers .
Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
Sir , I lack advancement .
How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark ?
I do not well understand that .
Will you play upon this pipe ?
My lord , I can not .
I pray you .
Believe me , I can not .
I do beseech you .
I know no touch of it , my lord .
It is as easy as lying .
But these can not I command to any utterance of harmony .
You would seem to know my stops .
Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
Call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you can not play upon me .
God bless you , sir .
My lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel ?
By th ' mass , and 'tis like a camel indeed .
Methinks it is like a weasel .
It is backed like a weasel .
Or like a whale .
Very like a whale .
Then I will come to my mother by and by .
I will say so .
Tis now the very witching time of night , When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world .
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on .
I will speak daggers to her but use none .
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
I like him not , nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range .
Therefore prepare you .
I your commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you .
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies .
We will ourselves provide .
The cease of majesty Dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw What's near it with it .
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount , To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , Each small annexment , petty consequence , Attends the boisterous ruin .
Never alone Did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
Arm you , I pray you , to this speedy voyage .
For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free-footed .
We will haste us .
My lord , he's going to his mother's closet .
Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process .
I'll warrant she'll tax him home .
And , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother , Since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear The speech , of vantage .
Fare you well , my liege .
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know .
Thanks , dear my lord .
It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't , A brother's murder .
So much for him .
That can not be , since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder : My crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
May one be pardoned and retain th ' offense ?
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice , And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law .
But 'tis not so above .
What can it not ?
Yet what can it when one can not repent ?
O bosom black as death !
O limed soul that , struggling to be free , Art more engaged !
Help , angels .
Make assay .
Now might I do it pat .
Now he is a-praying .
And now I'll do 't .
And so he goes to heaven .
And so am I revenged. , That would be scanned .
And am I then revenged
No .
Words without thoughts never to heaven go .
He will come straight .
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works .
Speak to her , Hamlet .
